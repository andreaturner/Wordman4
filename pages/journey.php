        <div class="songs center">
            And when the moon swims &#8216;cross the blackest of sky&#44;<br>
            Oft&#8217; then we fail with our very own eye<br>
            To see the silhouette of souls masked &#38216;gainst the light&#44; <br>
            Taking flight&#8230;<br>
            Ne&#8217;re giving thought to the hearts left behind<br>
            Searching through bewildered tears&#46;<br><br>

            Is it so strange that it should be ever thus&#44;<br>
            Our own incomprehension of passing in trust or<br>
            Is it only the tears and the lonely that blind us<br>
            To the journey ongoing&#63;<br>
            So oft&#8217; we should look ahead on the path<br>
            &#8216;Stead the road there behind<br>
            Though we do as we must in our growing&#46;<br><br>

            
            And if on that dark moon&#45;lit night beyond dusk&#44;<br>
            When our own passion swells and &#8216;ere overwhelms us<br>
            And we cry both in anger and heartfelt sorrow&#44;<br>
            Would it help if we listened&#8230;<br>
            Would we hear a voice whisper&#44; soothing pain with truth&#44;<br>
            So oft&#8217; discarded by most foolish youth&#46;<br>
            A voice&#44; whispering back with most tender caring&#46;<br><br>

            &#8220;My child I would save you this moment&#39;s despairing&#44;<br>
            Anguish not over words&#44; spoken or silent&#46;<br>
            Thus is it often&#44; but know in the quiet&#8230;<br>
            I have loved you in life&#8230; felt the depth of your own&#44;<br>
            Now a greater love calls me and I gladly go home&#46;&#8221;<br><br>    

            And thus with a whisper&#44; not oft&#8217; as a cry&#44;<br>
            The truth once again is birthed<br>
            Breaking out &#8216;cross the sky to that moon<br>
            That stands waiting for each of our souls&#44;<br>
            For that step of our journey&#8230; that only God knows&#46;<br>
