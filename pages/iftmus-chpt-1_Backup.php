                    Between the darkening sky and the damp mossy ground, the leaves of the white barked Ac-ca trees shivered under a more casual caress of
                    breeze, the subtle sound seeming to applaud the whole scene as its purpose was to witness.
                </div>
                
                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back
                    while Fa-tera made her pronouncement. <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time, my children.&rdquo;</span> the small dark cat&#39;s head twitched
                    with a quick side motion, a nervous tick carried from the sunwalk of her birth, <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time to share what thee have learned.  It is the time
                    for this one to listen, and as our ancestors did, judge thy worth.&rdquo;</span>  &nbsp;She gazed quietly upon the faces of her anxious students. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee will, in thy turn, recite Kylor. If thee pass the testing this
                    night, thee shall go out and witness Kylor to all cat, carrying on the sacred trust of those that have done so before.&rdquo;</span>
                </div>
                
                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Fa-tera and Ja-natia nodded, slowly in turn to each of the twelve cats. This semi-submissive bow was part of the ritual of a Teachers acceptance of the younger
                    cats worth, at this stage in their testing. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Each of thee is a reminder of what we have been, what we are and what we can be.  If thee pass this testing, let
                    all cat acknowledge with respect what thee have earned&#46;&#46;&#46;  and all that thee represent!&rdquo;</span>

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    The eye-moons of Re-nell peered through a tattered cloud that was swimming hesitantly across the darkened sky. The white light from the twin moons merely added more of a
                    gold wash to the flickering fire in the clearing. The reflections of both fire and moons shimmered in the eyes of each young cat. 
                </div>
                
                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Fa-tera smiled inwardly. The old teacher knew, should the fire be dead and the moons in hiding, there would still be a youthful touch of spark in all their eyes. They were
                    all so anxiously alive; idealistic hearts burning with dream fire!

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    These twelve cats were on the threshold of becoming the newest generation of Shi-kauti, the keepers of Ky-lore in Iftmus. This night was the last sunfall before Di-chant
                    and the time of their testing.

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Far in the distance a chilling howl, from a roving pack of Woodwars, sliced through the still night air. Fa-tera turned her gaze in the direction of the insidious cry.
                    She allowed herself a moment to wonder why a pack was down this far from the lo-hills?
                </div>
                
                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Woodwars, though ferocious, were basically cowards unless they outnumbered their victims. In packs they could bring down a large, healthy Ti-breen cat. Alone or in pairs
                    they would only take on a cat, if it were weakened, wounded, or an unfortunate cub separated from its pride. More often they stalked small defenseless animals, such as
                    ra-katoos or stray mud-waumps. True to the viciousness of their breed they were also known to turn on the weaker of their own, when hunger prevailed for fail of the hunt.

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    As if hearing her thoughts, Ja-natia Cha-tain faced the breeze with a tilt of her head and then mindspoke. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I sense their hunger but do not
                    taste any other purpose in their movements. They are midst hunt and no threat to us.&rdquo;</span> Wisps of her long white fur lashed in the wind like graceful white smoke tendrils.
                </div>
                
                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Another howl went up; this time it was the cry of success. Fa-tera shuddered and gave up a short prayer for the victim that loosed its spirit in the shedding of deathblood.
                    She nodded affirmation to her San-Tou and turned her attention back to the circle of cats, sighing, <span class="italic">&ldquo;This is life, the giving and taking of which belongs to the Spirit of Felis.&rdquo;</span>
                    With little else to add Fa-tera straightened her stance, <span class="italic">&ldquo;But thee are the conscience of our life. The heart and soul of Iftmus is Kylor&#46;&#46;&#46; the words!&rdquo;</span>
                    The old cat blinked and then allowed herself a moment away from formality with an uncharacteristic touch of sentiment. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee, my hearts, are my beloved children and in all of thee,
                    I am so very proud.&rdquo;</span>

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    The place of testing, sat right on the Tears Of Rensis, river&#39;s edge. The poetic side of Fa-tera always reveled in the soothing song of the fast flowing water. The water whispered and laughed
                    over rocks. It cooed and swallowed itself in deep eddies. It was the teasing of tomorrow to the land that lay before it today. It was an echo of yesterday from the mountains and the heavens
                    from which it flowed.

                    The river, Tears of Rensis, swept in from the furthest boundaries of the three provinces and met in the middle of Iftmus at the bottomless falls of Fina&#39;sha, the singular place where the tip of
                    each of the provinces touched. Something stirred in Fa-tera&#39;s heart. She silently vowed to make a pilgrimage to those falls in the near future.

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Nalas&#39;, the stone monoliths that surrounded the cats were a huddle of shadows from the past. The large stones were veined with greenstone and had been placed there by the Abyssinian cats
                    that once dwelt in La-mor. There was a peace to their presence, a tie with the past and the heritage of all cat. Only once an eight-season did they stir, as they had the so many sunwalks
                    before when Fa-tera had prepared for this testing.

                <div class="prologue-text">
                    Early sunwalk past, Fa-tera had entered Nalas&#39; from the riverside. The tall rocks shifted and grated within like the clearing of a stone throat. A group voice, many but one, spoke out
                    to her before she even faced the monoliths. &ldquo;Who&#46;&#46;&#46;, wakes&#46;&#46;&#46;, us?&rdquo; The voice was low and gritty like the rumbling of earth when stone caresses stone.

                    Now at this sunfall, Fa-tera still wondered, but let that wonder be swept to the side by her own anxiousness for her students. Restless on its own accord, the fire crackled with excitement
                    and threw out tiny, falling-star sparks that burned themselves out in multitudes of wishes before ever reaching the damp moss on the ground. Fa-tera added her own wish in among them. She
                    sighed as she looked proudly into the eyes of her children. She had raised them all, and she would now have to let them go. Why was it always, such a bite to the heart?

                    Among the varied cat before her, some were nearly three times Fa-tera&#39;s size, yet they all gazed lovingly back at her, as any small cub might its own natural mother. She shook off the warm,
                    as well as the subtle cold of what she was feeling. Finally with some reluctance she put on the veil of strict formality; the occasion demanded that she, as Teacher, do no less.

                now entering the clearing. The flickering light danced with the dark, adding deeper shadows to the cloak of formality. A dark, smaller,
                shorthaired cat strode ahead while a larger, white, longhaired cat took pace a respectful distance behind her. The trembling fire-light only
                accentuated, with shadow echoes, the twelve varied breed of cat sitting in a half circle, awaiting the arrival of the two.

                Backdrop to all the cats, the stage for this formal place of testing, was Nalas&#39;; twelve, tall, stone monoliths standing quiet. The granite

                Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back

                with a quick side motion, a nervous tick carried from the sunwalk of her birth, <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time to share what thee have learned.  It is the time

                The eye-moons of Re-nell peered through a tattered cloud that was swimming hesitantly across the darkened sky. The white light from the twin moons merely added more of a
                gold wash to the flickering fire in the clearing. The reflections of both fire and moons shimmered in the eyes of each young cat.

            <div class="prologue-text">
                Fa-tera smiled inwardly. The old teacher knew, should the fire be dead and the moons in hiding, there would still be a youthful touch of spark in all their eyes. They were

                These twelve cats were on the threshold of becoming the newest generation of Shi-kauti, the keepers of Ky-lore in Iftmus. This night was the last sunfall before Di-chant
                and the time of their testing.

            <div class="prologue-text">
                Far in the distance a chilling howl, from a roving pack of Woodwars, sliced through the still night air. Fa-tera turned her gaze in the direction of the insidious cry.
                She allowed herself a moment to wonder why a pack was down this far from the lo-hills?
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Woodwars, though ferocious, were basically cowards unless they outnumbered their victims. In packs they could bring down a large, healthy Ti-breen cat. Alone or in pairs
                they would only take on a cat, if it were weakened, wounded, or an unfortunate cub separated from its pride. More often they stalked small defenseless animals, such as
                ra-katoos or stray mud-waumps. True to the viciousness of their breed they were also known to turn on the weaker of their own, when hunger prevailed for fail of the hunt.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                As if hearing her thoughts, Ja-natia Cha-tain faced the breeze with a tilt of her head and then mindspoke. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I sense their hunger but do not
                taste any other purpose in their movements. They are midst hunt and no threat to us.&rdquo;</span> Wisps of her long white fur lashed in the wind like graceful white smoke tendrils.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text">
                Another howl went up; this time it was the cry of success. Fa-tera shuddered and gave up a short prayer for the victim that loosed its spirit in the shedding of deathblood.
                She nodded affirmation to her San-Tou and turned her attention back to the circle of cats, sighing, <span class="italic">&ldquo;This is life, the giving and taking of which belongs to the Spirit of Felis.&rdquo;</span>
                With little else to add Fa-tera straightened her stance, <span class="italic">&ldquo;But thee are the conscience of our life. The heart and soul of Iftmus is Kylor&#46;&#46;&#46; the words!&rdquo;</span>
                The old cat blinked and then allowed herself a moment away from formality with an uncharacteristic touch of sentiment. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee, my hearts, are my beloved children and in all of thee,
                I am so very proud.&rdquo;</span>

            <div class="prologue-text">
                Ja-natia Cha-tain gave pause, with a mental nod, measuring and noting depth of heart of this cat. The eyes of all twelve cats squeezed closed, caught short by the unprecedented flattery from
                their usually strict and formal teacher.

                Chosen at birth from various families of cat in the three provinces of Iftmus, these young cats had all been brought to Pursong as kittens. The sanctuary school known as Seftora in the
                Province of La-mor was an isolated glade, a sacred place that lay nestled between Gift-wa, the lake of silent waters and the river, Tears of Rensis. Here in Pursong, Seftora was the place
                of learning, a sanctuary respected by all cat since the early days of the first ruling Sa-bata cats. Here in a vast area of beautiful trees and lush grass, dotted with yellow-green lich
                moss, generations of cat were raised and taught by the Teacher to become Shi-kauti, keepers of Kylor. Here they learned the daily routines of living and survival, as well as being ingrained
                with the histories, the laws, the lore and traditions of all cats of Iftmus. This was what bound all cat to one family. The sum of all cat experience was Kylor!

                The place of testing, sat right on the Tears Of Rensis, river&#39;s edge. The poetic side of Fa-tera always reveled in the soothing song of the fast flowing water. The water whispered and laughed
                over rocks. It cooed and swallowed itself in deep eddies. It was the teasing of tomorrow to the land that lay before it today. It was an echo of yesterday from the mountains and the heavens
                from which it flowed.

                The river, Tears of Rensis, swept in from the furthest boundaries of the three provinces and met in the middle of Iftmus at the bottomless falls of Fina&#39;sha, the singular place where the tip of
                each of the provinces touched. Something stirred in Fa-tera&#39;s heart. She silently vowed to make a pilgrimage to those falls in the near future.

                Nalas&#39;, the stone monoliths that surrounded the cats were a huddle of shadows from the past. The large stones were veined with greenstone and had been placed there by the Abyssinian cats
                that once dwelt in La-mor. There was a peace to their presence, a tie with the past and the heritage of all cat. Only once an eight-season did they stir, as they had the so many sunwalks
                before when Fa-tera had prepared for this testing.

                Early sunwalk past, Fa-tera had entered Nalas&#39; from the riverside. The tall rocks shifted and grated within like the clearing of a stone throat. A group voice, many but one, spoke out
                to her before she even faced the monoliths. &ldquo;Who&#46;&#46;&#46;, wakes&#46;&#46;&#46;, us?&rdquo; The voice was low and gritty like the rumbling of earth when stone caresses stone.

                green eyes betrayed her part Abyssinian blood and turned a phosphorous glow. She nodded towards a large dry thornthistle branch, and with a flash that emanated first from her eyes,
                the branch burst into flame. She had used that part of Sha-talon called Ma-hosta, &ldquo;fire of dreams&rdquo;. A crescendo of fire washed the clearing with renewed, warm light.

                They relished encouragement and praise and like the Chaun, they seemed to have a limited understanding of Ma&#39;chona, &ldquo;Mindspeak.&rdquo; The Gindoo could hear but not mindspeak
                back. They resembled the Pur-rocia that dwelt in the forests of Pa-tan, but unlike their ferocious cousins, the Gindoo were a smaller, more intelligent breed. The two extra limbs not
                used for walking were ideal for carrying and moving things. Fa-tera had no qualms with their treatment here in Sefttora and other parts of La-mor, but she was uncomfortably aware of the
                more slave-like conditions of they and their cousins in the province of Pa-tan.

                Her thoughts swam slowly back over the past generations of cubs she had raised to become Shi-kauti. So many mewing, spitting, curious balls of fur arriving in all sizes; they were all
                her children! For the first time in the Teacher&#39;s whole life she conceded she was old; she flinched. Admission did not make the fact any more palatable. The cat chuckled to herself
                and quickly amended, &ldquo;Maybe not so much old as thee are just&#46;&#46;&#46; weary.&rdquo; She blinked. It was a tired that crept down into her bones and splashed back out in the
                gray hairs that flecked her once shiny black coat. Again her head twitched and she laughed inwardly. &ldquo;What a portrait thee must portray.&rdquo; Truly, it was getting close to the
                time for her to pass down the title of &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;. Pass it down to Ja-natia, just as Fa-sinto had passed it down to her, when she was his San-Tou, so many sunfalls ago. The
                thought of no longer being the Teacher, caused a shudder to chase down her spine. She was proud of her work and until now, never realized just how empty she would feel without it.

                Fa-tera knew this part of Kylor well. It told of the Abyssinian cats, ancestors of her blood that had originally dwelt in this province of La-mor. Their breed had learned to touch a
                different part of Flow: the balance of all life and land in Iftmus. From it they drew Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus. Ma-chona, &ldquo;The whisper of Felis&rdquo; was mindspeak
                and the Sa-bata cat had taught that. The Abyssinians touched a different part of Sha-talon; Ma-nasta, &ldquo;The weight of ages,&rdquo; which allowed them to move things by levitation.
                Ma-hosta, &ldquo;The fire of dreams,7rdquo; allowed them to create fire as Fa-tera just had. Ma-chena, &ldquo;The steps of the wind,&rdquo allowed them to transport themselves or others
                short distances. Up till now no other cat had ever mastered those aspects of the gifts. Eventually the Abyssinians moved up onto the Grasswater, separating themselves and any further
                knowledge of Sha-talon from all other breed of cat. Still there had been that one fateful day&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;

                the jokes to heart and Fa-sinto would be crushed that his teasing had been taken as anything but. Almost in tears he would say, <span class="italic">&ldquo;Fa-tera, Fa-tera do not do this

                wave and one continued the walk up to Fa-sinto. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo;</span> he gave a formal nod.

                Even on this last sunfall, the mystery surrounding the Abyssinian&#39;s disappearance had not changed a word. Fa-tera, like every other cat, would continue to speculate as to their fate&#46;&#46;&#46;
                and in fact did so again with a forlorn sigh.

                Ja-natia, Fa-tera&#39;s San-tou, was a Cha-tain cat. Their breed had let no other cat enter the Grasswater, until the sunwalk they allowed the Abyssinians on. Now they kept the fate of
                those cats just as private. Ja-natia herself had refused to be broached on the subject. What was the secret? What was more important than the truth of Kylor? How long were they to go on
                wondering?
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                There was one sad truth that stood out from wistful speculation. Since the Abyssinian cats had disappeared, there was an uneasiness seeping into the land, a feeling of wrong that refused
                to be cast off. It was much like a damp fog sitting just footfalls ahead, always out of touch no matter how hard one tried to chase it down.  It was oppressive and it was only getting worse.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Kylor told how, earlier in Iftmus, most cats broke off into feuding prides and started claiming territories. Even Ren-sis could not bring order or caring back. Something vile had overshadowed
                the land and was suffocating the spirit of every living thing.

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                A distant tremor caused the ground beneath her to tremble, adding its own voice to her worst suspicions.  As Nalas&#39; had said, Iftmus was in pain; the land and all that lived upon it were no
                longer in harmony. There was no peace to be felt, only a vague sense of torment: a whisper-promise of impending doom. The worst part of all this was the gossamer fear-feeling she had long
                cradled; a feeling that somewhere, something seemed to be enjoying all of this, taking sustenance like a kitten from its mother&#39;s teat. She could feel its consuming greed, its insatiable
                hunger. It was a hunger that would not stop feeding till all life was sucked dry.

            <div class="prologue-text-center-italic">
                &ldquo;And when Sha-talon and the Abyssinians left Iftmus, a great emptiness filled the land. Ren-sis knew he was at the end, even though it was before his time. He turned the right to rule
                over to The Li-horan cat, and none could argue, as he had no heir. The last of his pride were the last of the great and honored Sa-bata cats.&rdquo;

                Fa-tera snorted, her thoughts once more running astray. It had been in those times, cat first drew the death blood of cat. Even now the Li-horan and the Ti-breen cat supposedly shed death
                blood, over the right to rule. Why wasn&#39;t that spoken of in Kylor?

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                She felt nervous, her own questions bordered blasphemy. She offered up a quick apologetic prayer and again scolded herself. Was this the frailty of old age, despair brought on by too many
                sunfalls, or was her faith being shaken in the bite of a more subtle truth? Despite the self-scolding, Fa-tera's thoughts had taken her too close to her own buried doubts. Thanks to the
                spiritual stumble, she was recognizing those doubts and in so doing, giving them a life of their own. From here on, the cat had no choice but to be haunted by the whispers of all she had,
                since before, refused to acknowledge.

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Kylor did indeed sidestep certain&#46;&#46;&#46; more recent issues. Too many of the changes going on in Iftmus were not accounted for, especially in the region of Pa-tan. The old cat
                shivered. Could this mean that past Shi-kauti had some part in placing insidious lies or half-truths into Kylor? She had to believe they couldn&#39;t. They were her adopted cubs, chosen,
                raised, and tested, all so carefully. She was responsible for them, for Kylor, for all cats in Iftmus!

                Shi-kauti of Kylor always went out in pairs, two pair to each province. No Shi-kauti was ever without another by their side, so the validity of any additions to Ky-lor could never be disputed.

                But still the gnawing doubt had sunk its teeth into the flesh of her soul. She might continue to run, but the demon had found the jugular. At this rate, doubt would continue to bleed her
                until faith was dead. Catlore said, &ldquo;The shedding of souls blood are the seasons passing. The loss of honesty, faith or dreams, merely promises that one may never again awaken and
                blink through the eyes of innocence.&rdquo;

                The ground shook ever so softly, a deep and sorrowful rumble. These ground tremors had been occurring at an ever-increasing rate, as had the whispered tales of newly occurring firestorms
                over the Pri-hy Mountains. It was rumored that at times, the heavens burned like the Grasswater during a storm-caused flash-fire. Though the stories might appear embellished or slightly
                exaggerated, too many cat were recounting similar variations and that it made it impossible to simply discount them!

                Again the nagging demon&#46;&#46;&#46; why hadn&#39;t any of her Shi-kauti ever brought these reports back to her?  What of the whispers of strange creatures seen in the deep swamps of
                Cry-mar, down near the borders of La-mor and Pa-tan?  More questions with yet fewer answers. Why did the land itself feel so wrong? Why wasn&#39;t Kylor keeping up with even the local gossip?
                Why had her two older pair of Shi-kauti not returned from Pa-tan last Di-Chant? Questions chasing their tails, plaguing like pestering carrion-eaters awaiting the death of a next meal.

             <div class="prologue-text"> 
                It was customary for all Shi-kauti to return to La-mor each Di-Chant, not only in tribute to their Teacher and the Spirit of Felis, but more important, to recount their experiences over
                past sunfalls, to bring up to date any changes or additions to Kylor. Occasionally a few had, in the past, missed Di-Chant due to traveling conditions or circumstances in their respected
                province, but they would always show later. Four Shi-kauti had not shown up last Di-Chant or been heard from since.

                How serious her fears were, would be proven by the next sunwalk. This coming Di-Chant was not just the sharing and additions to Kylor, but Da&#39;moshk, the time of passing of title. All
                Shi-kauti had to return to relinquish their roles to their younger heirs. None of her children had ever missed this Di-Chant, no Shi-kauti for any reason at any time! Certainly none ever
                would&#46;&#46;&#46;?  Her head hung low by the weight of her mood as she went back to listening.

                The last verses were quietly mindspoken by Chi-kaw, a Lingst cat from the low hills in the southern portion of La-mor. He was a quiet, solitary cat with a troubled spirit.
                Though he had no enemies here, throughout his training, it could certainly be said that he allowed few friends other than Fa-tera and Sa-toug&#39; the Shi-kauti he would
                travel across La-mor with. Still he made up in fervor and faith what he lacked in social grace.

                Fa-tera closed her eyes, drifting in the currents and the dark mood of these and many of the prophecies of Pursong. Eddies of memories swept her back to when she was
                first brought to Sefttora as a cub.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Young Fa-tera had a reckless sense of adventure. She refused to stay where the old Teacher, Fa-sinto had directed the new cubs to play. Instead she had cautiously followed
                the old cat. It was then she had seen her first and last Abyssinian ancestor, by virtue of her own partial blood. The Abyssinian&#39;s name had been Bastet, no larger than some
                of the smaller cats residing in La-mor, but there was a majesty that emanated from her, a very power in her presence. Bastet&#39;s silver black fur was sleek and there was
                a grace in her walk that made her look ageless.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Of the many things Fa-tera would remember, it was the Abyssinian&#39;s eyes that haunted her memories. Those eyes had been much greener than her own and they danced with a
                fire that burned constantly and not just when the cat was using Sha-talon. It was a flood of green, alive, fighting with itself to keep from spilling out.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Once Fa-sinto had left the clearing, Bastet strode over to Fa-tera&#39;s hiding place. There was a calm assurance in her manner and when she turned
                her gaze upon the young cat, there was only a warm wash of love that made the kitten want to return the same. Unbidden, Fa-tera stepped out from
                behind the bush where she hid and walked slowly forward, sniffing, seeking mood, until the two cats were almost nose to nose. 
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Bastet&#39;s mind spoke out to her with the authority of soft thunder, her tone a caress of a soft rain following. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I would venture
                little sister, thee and I will be seeing each other again.&rdquo;<span> The Abyssinian cat scrutinized Fa-tera even closer, a touch of magic reaching out
                from her burning eyes. It snaked in and around Fa-tera&#39;s head and then returned from whence it came. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Yes&#46;&#46;&#46; yes my
                young one, one sunwalk soon, but not soon enough, thee will walk the footfalls thee would not wish to call thy own. I give these words that thee may be ready.&rdquo;</span>
                Her gaze penetrated Fa-tera&#39;s soul, her mindspeak urgent.<span class="italic">&ldquo;Teach the many little one, but be ready for the few, among which
                thee are numbered.&rdquo;</span> There was a buzz&#46;&#46;&#46; a numbing of the mind that caused the rest of the words to slur. When Fa-tera shook her head
                the old cat was smiling, almost sadly. She addressed her for the first time by name. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Fa-tera, thy blood is the blood of all cats,
                even ours. Judge not harshly, for there are stories beneath stories, words behind words. Surely even the foolish wise cannot know them all!
                When it is time, thee will remember what has been said here. Protect thy heart that it may stay ever young. Bless thee and forgive us.&rdquo;</span>

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                There was melancholy to Bastet&#39;s strange benediction but as she turned and walked away, Fa-tera had no time to ponder it. Fa-sinto, her teacher had just
                returned. Thinking she had been innocently pestering their guest he cuffed her lightly on the ear with a gentle swipe of his paw. <span class="italic"></span>
                &ldquo;Go on nosy one. This is no business of yours. Go&#46;&#46;&#46; go join the others!&rdquo;</span> She scampered away not bothering to justify herself,
                but&#46;&#46;&#46;
            </div>
        
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                &#46;&#46;&#46;still she wondered even now, if that benediction had been a blessing or a curse? As a Ch&#39;aun, &ldquo;mixed blood&rdquo;, Fa-tera had always
                been an enigma. She alone, among all Ch&#39;aun, could Ma-chona &ldquo;mindspeak&rdquo;. This was a gift all cat of pure blood shared. Though mixed bloods could hear the
                Ma-chona of other cats, they could not mindspeak back. They could not draw Ma-nasta, <span class="italic">&ldquo;The weight of the spirit&rdquo;</span>or Ma-hosta,
                <span class="italic">&ldquo;The fire of dreams&rdquo;</span> or Ma-chena, <span class="italic">&ldquo;The trails of the wind&rdquo;</span> and thus came the abuse
                nurtured by the ignorance and arrogance of most cat of pure blood. Ch&#39;aun were treated as lesser cat.

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Anger welled up in Fa-tera and it tasted bitter. She had only been given her position by virtue of the arts she wielded and her unexpected ability to mindspeak.
                If not for that, she would have been, like all other Ch&#39;aun, an outcast from the main body of cat. They were all shunned, often mistreated, until they died
                or fled to the Grasswater seeking some fabled sanctuary.
            </div>
            
            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                No one really knew what happened to the Ch&#39;aun that ventured to the Grasswater. The Cha-tain cats that dwelt in that vast area would neither speak of it nor
                allow anyone to enter on to their plain. Even the Shi-kauti that ministered there were allowed only restricted entry and allowed none to broach this subject.

            <div class="prologue-text"> 
                Here again Ja-natia Cha-tain was no different and certainly no less secretive. Rumors abounded; there were stories of a refuge where all cats were treated equal,
                talk of death marches and mass gravesites and the whispered &ldquo;lost in the mists with the Abyssinians&rdquo;. None but the refugee Ch&#39;aun, or the Cha-tain
                could say for sure, and since none of the Ch&#39;aun ever came back, and none of the Cha-tain chose to share&#46;&#46;&#46; varying views and guesses would no doubt

                Fa-tera twitched and tried to swallow back some of the anger she felt rising within. There should be no secrets, not when it came to Kylor.
                A piece of catlore came to her, helping to smother some of that anger. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Slow careful steps on a sure course, bring thee closer to
                home than a heated run in the wrong direction!&rdquo;</span> The muscles down her spine quivered as she twitched, and chased for the calm.  &#39;Yes,
                yes&#46;&#46;&#46; thee should slow down old cat. Thee are getting careless with thy emotions and after all&#46;&#46;&#46; good change will come, as surely
                as bad.&#39; She didnt feel any better, regardless the platitudes she recited.

                The Shi-kauti had finished the Prophecies of Pursong. Ja-natia had moved them into the Ska-lation Verse, meant to be mindsung with a mix of &ldquo;pain-cry&rdquo;
                and &ldquo;warn-cry&rdquo;. The author was long held to have been Rensis, the last ruling Sa-bata cat, though most would rather cast it off as foolish cat-lore.
                Fa-tera accompanied that last thought with a nervous jerk of her head and proceeded quietly to listen to the prophecies, rather than dwell on her own dark broodings.
