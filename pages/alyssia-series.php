                    There was a time their kind were feared, respected, or at the very least, tolerated.

                    <span class="large">B</span>y the time of the turning of Moon Crest in the rule of Chir-kaung, 140/210 & 50 the mood had changed. Witchcraft had been declared heresy by the church.
                    Practitioners were sought out and put to trial; tested by fire or water. In either case those tests usually sent them to be judged by Orcala, who created us all.

                    mediums, to be treated no better than their animal counterparts.

                    <span class="large">T</span>his culminated at a time when Bako-lyn and all its surrounding provinces came under attack by the outside hordes, the Myrsongot. The use of the
                    black arts in the ensuing war proved that witchcraft was behind this onslaught and substantiated by the ruling faction; there was an edict to eliminate all traces of this
                    diabolical and evil practice.
