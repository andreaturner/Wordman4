                intrusion and small animals scamper odd directions in apparent abundance. There seems to be, to my untrained eye, a motley collection of people, albeit a large tribe
                with their tents spread out before us.

                ungodly disciple. She lands on his shoulder and then jumps to the ground without incident, though her talons would have torn the shirt and the flesh from any other man.

                at the bird and there is merely a silent look between both of them. I myself am too quietly surprised to offer any more input.
