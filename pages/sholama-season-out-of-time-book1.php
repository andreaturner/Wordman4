            <span>S</span>even-year-old Sholama laughed and tossed a snowball at her best friend. The snow hit the heavy fur of the bear she called Jomalok.
            With great exaggeration the giant bear reared up, standing ten of her high, and grabbed at his belly. <i>&ldquo;I am sorely wounded. I fear this
            is the end of the greatest animal who ever walked through the forests of Shakatem. All who live in the shadows of these forests will mourn this day;
            the day the great bear Jamalok was cut down in his prime &rdquo;&period;&period;&period;&period;</i>

            <i><span>&ldquo;N</span>o, no don&#39;t mourn for me. Though I am sure I would have done more for the world if I had not been so cruelly taken from it&#33;&rdquo;</i>

            <i><span>&ldquo;J</span>amalok, that&#39;s not how a bear dies&#33;&rdquo;</i>&#32;&#32;  The little girl marched up to him and almost fell over backwards trying to see up to his massive face.

        <div class="series-text-book-axtoph">
            <span>J</span>amalok looked down at her, scratching the side of his huge head. <i>&ldquo;How do you know? Have you ever seen a bear die?&rdquo;</i>

            <span>S</span>holama put her hands on her hips and looked as indignant as a seven year old could.<i> &ldquo;I know all about animals. My father&#39;s a Shaman and someday I will be a
            Shaman too&#33;&rdquo;</i>
        </div>
        <div class="series-text-book-axtoph">
            <span>T</span>he great bear closed his eyes and with his nose in the air, shook his head side to side. <i>&ldquo;Nope, a girl can&#39;t be a Shaman. You told me that yourself.  &#32;So&period;&period;&period;
            if you&#39;re done interrupting me, I really need to get back to my dying&#33;&rdquo;</i>&#32;&#32;The bear cleared his throat, <i>&ldquo;There is much that should be said to remember this noble animal, this
            passionate soul named Jamalok.&rdquo;</i>

        <div class="series-text-book-axtoph">
            <span>S</span>holama stepped up onto his foot and pushed against his leg. <i>&ldquo;Fall down and die quietly.&rdquo;</i>   Jamalok tsked and sighed. <i>&ldquo;Whatever&period;&period;&period; I
            can&#39;t go on dying if you&#39;re goimg tp be standing on my paw; it takes away from the dignity of the moment.&rdquo;</i>
