            <span class="large">T</span>here is an undiscovered turn on Iftmus. It is a dark buried secret that may be the only threat to Baushra&#39;. Twisted magic
            and a devouring evil, rape the living land and Iftmus trembles in its final death throes as this force splits the heavens and enters the realm.
            The shift of power and balance on these three worlds will &ldquo;uncreate&rdquo; the whole universe much like a rampant virus would spread in
            a healthy body, once taken hold on only a group of cells. Even now the most powerful of all the disciples have gathered to await the physical
            manifistation of their new god.

            themselves and others and have won as much, as they have suffered and lost. They have been the best of comrades. They have been their own worst
            enemy. There has been death and loss on both sides and there are wounds that will never heal.

            worlds, so many ages ago!
