                and slow realizations of the 60&#39;s. Like all of us we think our time was the best. I was timid and unsure but my heritage demanded I
                pick my lot in life and pursue it with a passion.

                <span>I</span> have been writing stories since grade school. A few of my books were even confiscated in high school with a warning and 
                a half smile; I suppose I should have had the decency to blush.

                <span>D</span>uring that time I discovered another outlet that intrigued me. I studied the words and music of the folk &amp; rock genre. I taught myself guitar by removing all the strings and putting them back on, two at a time. Discerning which combination of fret positions sounded
                pleasant, I would then add two more strings. When done, I had finally formed chords; no clue as to what they were called until I started interacting
                with other musicians. From then on I was writing my own original music. It was a rewarding time when people cared and listened. I played local bars and made a fair living.

                <span>I</span> am currently a published, Performing / Songwriter / Poet, and have composed over 1,140 songs. After what seems a lifetime of performing my music across the country, up and down the West Coast, inward to the Midwest and Southwest and finally ending up on the East Coast, I am once again home; residing in
                the Pacific Northwest.

            <div class="margin-bottom-1">
                <span>I</span> continued writing stories for years, I treated it as an ongoing exercise; something to do when I wasn&#39;t creating or performing my music. I am now winding down the traveling/performing aspect of music while recording my own songs in my home studio; smooth jazz instrumental versions of my varied compositions. I've since redirected my focus on my writings and my passion for photography.

                <span>B</span>ack on the road, while playing music in Summit, New Jersey, I was lucky enough to meet a woman who rekindled hope and inspiration to my heart; this is a good thing since, by then, I was a sputtering candle. She tells me that she is my souvenir from the East Coast and while I have to agree, I include Lesley as a force in this final endeavor in my life; she always refused to allow me to accept anything less than my best which she is&#33;
