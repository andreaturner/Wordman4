                                La-mor they were the first to control and treat Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus, as an art.   They separated themselves from all other
                                cats to reside at Greensun and it was then that the Cha-tain cat closed off the larger portion of the Grasswater and allowed no other cat
                                to trespass it. Since then, little more is known about the Abyssinians. The last entry into Kylor of their disappearance was the fact that
                                they totally vanished almost within a single Sunfall with no message nor explanation. The Cha-tain make no comment of it other than to
                                affirm the Abyssinians are indeed gone.

                                A large flamingo type bird on Iftmus that keeps to the air unless nesting in the high cliff areas. It sings to its mate in flight and for the most part is nocturnal.
                                It&#39;s song has created catlore that says &ldquo;The wandering bird,  carrying it&#39;s lament across the lonely night skies shall remind all cat to listen to the land, for

                                A large bristle-furred animal on Iftmus, resembling a cross between a wild boar and a small wolf; a carrion hunter that usually stays to the forest. It hunts in packs and when frenzied has been known
                                to bring down several Ti-breen cats. For the most part it hunts smaller animals or sick or separated cat, mostly at night.

                                the ground requiring much runway to accommodate the four wings and for that reason is hunted for food by cat.

                            of old cat. Scores of cat backed one or the other Li-horan, each adding to the tangle of snarled mind speak, as the two males vied for the

                            bled from those eyes and fled down the hill; a wash of fire spreading out over all cat, including the two combatants. None below seemed to notice the phenomenon; the black cat snorted his

                            heedless spilling of blood. The carnage might well have been narcotic. Both prides of the two challengers, twenty-nine male and female Li-horan cat also rushed each other, all with the

                            crippled or maimed. The blood stained land bore silent testimony to the carnage, punctuated by dying breaths.

                            in and around themselves, to form an exquisite rod; complex and busy yet still smooth to the touch. Within the spinning of the filaments, intricate patterns could be seen, each embracing a whisper of the dark magic held

                            The Mage whirled; angered that he must be the one to pronounce the words. &ldquo;By your actions and your heresy, you and your race have condemned yourselves!&rdquo; The last, he said with more regret than he was formally allowed to show.

                            There was a clap of thunder as the elements collided, one that made the world of Axtoph go deaf and freeze. Etue gasped, as if trying to plead with an angry god. &ldquo;Forgive&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo; and he dropped dead where he knelt.
                            Samone let a quiet tear run down his face. &ldquo;There is no forgiveness for what we, the both of us, have done here my friend.&rdquo;

                            they were part of his kingdom. The dying screams of men, women and children drifted out in the night desert air on an unholy wind.

                            the will freely given. All of my children must Understand&#46;&#46;&#46; what is done is done. No river flows backwards!&rdquo; The mist around the sleeping god
                            coalesced and turned to tears. Just for a brief moment, between sleep and dream, Chaos was forced back to his place, for &ldquo;The Word and the Will&rdquo; were strong.
