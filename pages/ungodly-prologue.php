                    <span class="large">T</span>here are distant screams in the catacombs, all of them of less consequence than the pain of heated iron thrust against his side.
                    His flesh hisses like meat hanging over a tavern fire. The prisoner dangles in the air on frayed ropes. Writhing, he refuses to cry out. His tormentor laughs,
                    taking hideous delight in the contortions and the tears that spring, from what he is inflicting; still the little man seems frustrated that he cannot get his
                    victim to scream aloud or beg.

                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he dungeons reek of urine and waste. The torches are an old man&#39;s eyes that flicker and cause tears more than give insight as to
                    the cruelty ongoing. The rats number more than the screams of the prisoners. The dark of the dungeons barely live up to the dark of the souls of those who are
                    perpetuating sin.

                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he tormentor heats the next iron, the doors of the prison burst open. An overweight, over-robed, sweating priest rushes into the cell,
                    &ldquo;You&#39;re going to kill him you idiot! And what good does that do us without a confession?&rdquo; The tormenter cringes from the obvious authority of this antagonist.

                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he prisoner forces open, closed eyes, squinting against the blood. &ldquo;You&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo; he rasps, &ldquo;it is you who have
                    done this to me&#46;&#46;&#46; to your own agent?&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he fat man shrugs and lifts a sandal, to inspect the bile he has just stepped in; his voice reeks of condescension. &ldquo;You are of
                    little value any longer. In fact&#46;&#46;&#46; you seek to bring the church down.&rdquo; He wipes his nose with fragrant linen feigning off the repugnant results of his own orders.
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">I</span>t hurts to talk but the prisoner forces words through a whisper. &ldquo;What lie is this? I have never sought to bring the church down.&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he fat man waves a finger at him like he is lecturing an errant youth. &ldquo;When you disagree with the church&#46;&#46;&#46; you seek to bring us down.
                    Do you think we don&#39;t keep tabs on those that feign allegiance?&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he prisoner spits, only to clear his mouth. &ldquo;Disagreement only threatens those who know they are wrong.&rdquo; He coughs, &ldquo;How can
                    I threaten a religion? I am but one man.&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he priest lets the tormentor wave the iron in front of the prisoners&#39; face. He and the tormentor both smile, enjoying the power. &ldquo;You
                    are the one who has to name yourself the heretic and repent. By doing so, you will acknowledge the rebellion and absorb the guilt. Who knows&#46;&#46;&#46; we might let you die quickly.&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he prisoner cracks a twisted smile against scab and bruising. His eyes suddenly smolder. &ldquo;In all the weeks I have been imprisoned here,
                    this is the first time you have found the courage to face me. Now you acknowledge your guilt.&rdquo; He twists his neck as if clearing a strained muscle.  &ldquo;This was all I
                    was waiting for. You have professed your guilt to your god, now it is your turn to face judgment!&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he fat priest&#39;s face drains color, he laughs hesitantly; &ldquo;Blasphemy!&rdquo; He looks at the tormentor. &ldquo;You heard it yourself&#46;&#46;&#46; blasphemy!&rdquo;
                    Though he doesn&#39;t step back, his voice betrays faint fear. He turns on the prisoner.  &ldquo;You are the ungodly disciple who is dying here!&rdquo;
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">&ldquo;Y</span>es I was.&rdquo; The prisoner strains and rises up on the ropes. One of the ragged hemp shackles snap like the sound of a gavel. With his freed arm, he
                    grabs the cowl of the priest&#39;s robe while his legs whip out like snakes and wrap the fat hypocrites&#39; neck. With a twist there is a crack and the obese one dies with a look of
                    surprise still on his face.
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">T</span>he tormentor watches, stunned, which allows the prisoner the time to drop the priest and use his free arm to wrest the branding rod away. He feels no remorse as
                    he thrusts it into the neck of the sick little man. The old fool never has the time to adequately reflect, how quickly lifes&#39; fortunes can change.
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">F</span>or the longest time the prisoner hangs there, almost resigned to the defeat, life routinely deals. Finally, after a deep expel of defiance and an indrawn
                    breath of commitment, he uses the hot iron to cut the last rope. His own body falls to the floor with no resistance offered or capable on his part. The heretic lies on the ground, a very
                    long moment, pressed to the damp and mossy stone. Before long he is rising with a rasp of vengeance; a slow whisper.
                </div>
                <div class="series-text-book-prologue">
                    <span class="large">&ldquo;T</span>he ungodly disciple,&rdquo; he sighs and rubs his face, wincing as his hands pass over fresh wounds; &ldquo;a fitting name.&rdquo;  He coughs; reaches down, drawing a sword
                    from the tormentors&#39; belt. With much effort, as well as frequent support from the stone walls, he staggers quietly out into the dark corridor. The prisoner&#39;s tortured figure, as well as his
                    labored breathing, eventually merge with the mist and become a story, a soon to be twisted legend, a romantic song that might very well be sung, off-key in taverns, long into many a future night.
