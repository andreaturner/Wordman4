            <span class="large">P</span>rophecy is fulfilled as nine reluctant heroes come together, three from each of the threatened worlds, Iftmus, Axtoph and Terra. Baushra&#39;,
            the anti-thesis of the creative force has found its&#39; host disciples in the Shinghaut priest of the late Babylon. They in turn have passed
            their deadly gifts on to thier new pawns on each of the three worlds. Now Iftmus, the land cats are in their death throes as the newly perverted
            magics of Sha-talon twist and pervert the balance of Flow.

            <span class="large">T</span>he nine comrades are pursued from the moment the first six of them come together on Iftmus. As they flee, they meet with the last remaining three
            and piece together some of the related prophesies. Since their own worlds are threatened as well, they are forced by events to set off in search
            of Greenstone, the corridor between all three worlds.

            <span class="large">W</span>ithin that quest they must not only discover the powers of Greenstone but also unravel the truth behind the long vanished race of Abyssinian cat
            who possessed the magics before the Panduran cat claimed thier new twisted version. It is here that one of the heroes must bury the demon of his own madness
            lest it betray his true motives. Another must do battle with race and age prejudices before they can even begin to confront the true enemy. A third must
            die and lose all innocence, if others are ever to be granted a chance at any type of life.

            <span class="large">G</span>reenstone is a religious artifact, rumored to be hidden in an area of Iftmus known as Fina&#39;sha Falls where the tri-rivers meet and tumble
            into a bottomless abyss. Fina&#39;sha Falls, a holy place, inhabited by the Nashanti, a large religious cult of fanatical purebred cat who will kill or
            be killed before letting these sacred grounds, the symbol of their heritage, be desicrated by outsiders or any noname Ch&#39;aun cat.

            sweep the sky in Pa-tan, and enter the forbidden fortress of Amas&#39;ka. There is a traitor in thier ranks and there is death among their own.

            on three worlds, fear them? For if indeed they do, the answer is not forthcoming since everything the group discovers only alludes to the horrors of their
            own impending doom and the bleak fates of the worlds they came from!
