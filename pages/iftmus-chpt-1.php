                        shed upward into the air as the flames reeled back from the unprovoked blow, giving the fire the animated appearance of bowing before two cats,
                        now entering the clearing. The flickering light danced with the dark, adding deeper shadows to the cloak of formality. A dark, smaller,
                        shorthaired cat strode ahead while a larger, white, longhaired cat took pace a respectful distance behind her. The trembling fire-light only
                        accentuated, with shadow echoes, the twelve varied breed of cat sitting in a half circle, awaiting the arrival of the two.

                        Backdrop to all the cats, the stage for this formal place of testing, was Nalas&#39;; twelve, tall, stone monoliths standing quiet. The granite
                        giants were brooding, spaced in a gentle arc, like the curve of a mother cat on her side, nursing her precious young.

                        Between the darkening sky and the damp mossy ground, the leaves of the white barked Ac-ca trees shivered under a more casual caress of
                        breeze, the subtle sound seeming to applaud the whole scene as its purpose was to witness.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Fa-tera, the Teacher, strode quietly into the waiting circle of cats. Ja-natia Cha-tain, her San-Tou, or novice teacher stood submissively back
                        while Fa-tera made her pronouncement. <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time, my children.&rdquo;</span> the small dark cat&#39;s head twitched
                        with a quick side motion, a nervous tick carried from the sunwalk of her birth, <span class="italic">&ldquo;It is thy time to share what thee have learned.  It is the time
                        for this one to listen, and as our ancestors did, judge thy worth.&rdquo;</span>  &nbsp;She gazed quietly upon the faces of her anxious students. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee will, in thy turn, recite Kylor. If thee pass the testing this
                        night, thee shall go out and witness Kylor to all cat, carrying on the sacred trust of those that have done so before.&rdquo;</span>

                        Fa-tera and Ja-natia nodded, slowly in turn to each of the twelve cats. This semi-submissive bow was part of the ritual of a Teachers acceptance of the younger
                        cats worth, at this stage in their testing. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Each of thee is a reminder of what we have been, what we are and what we can be.  If thee pass this testing, let

                        The eye-moons of Re-nell peered through a tattered cloud that was swimming hesitantly across the darkened sky. The white light from the twin moons merely added more of a
                        gold wash to the flickering fire in the clearing. The reflections of both fire and moons shimmered in the eyes of each young cat. 
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Fa-tera smiled inwardly. The old teacher knew, should the fire be dead and the moons in hiding, there would still be a youthful touch of spark in all their eyes. They were
                        all so anxiously alive; idealistic hearts burning with dream fire!

                        These twelve cats were on the threshold of becoming the newest generation of Shi-kauti, the keepers of Ky-lore in Iftmus. This night was the last sunfall before Di-chant
                        and the time of their testing.

                        Far in the distance a chilling howl, from a roving pack of Woodwars, sliced through the still night air. Fa-tera turned her gaze in the direction of the insidious cry.
                        She allowed herself a moment to wonder why a pack was down this far from the lo-hills?
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Woodwars, though ferocious, were basically cowards unless they outnumbered their victims. In packs they could bring down a large, healthy Ti-breen cat. Alone or in pairs
                        they would only take on a cat, if it were weakened, wounded, or an unfortunate cub separated from its pride. More often they stalked small defenseless animals, such as
                        ra-katoos or stray mud-waumps. True to the viciousness of their breed they were also known to turn on the weaker of their own, when hunger prevailed for fail of the hunt.

                        As if hearing her thoughts, Ja-natia Cha-tain faced the breeze with a tilt of her head and then mindspoke. <span class="italic">&ldquo;I sense their hunger but do not
                        taste any other purpose in their movements. They are midst hunt and no threat to us.&rdquo;</span> Wisps of her long white fur lashed in the wind like graceful white smoke tendrils.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Another howl went up; this time it was the cry of success. Fa-tera shuddered and gave up a short prayer for the victim that loosed its spirit in the shedding of deathblood.
                        She nodded affirmation to her San-Tou and turned her attention back to the circle of cats, sighing, <span class="italic">&ldquo;This is life, the giving and taking of which belongs to the Spirit of Felis.&rdquo;</span>
                        With little else to add Fa-tera straightened her stance, <span class="italic">&ldquo;But thee are the conscience of our life. The heart and soul of Iftmus is Kylor&#46;&#46;&#46; the words!&rdquo;</span>
                        The old cat blinked and then allowed herself a moment away from formality with an uncharacteristic touch of sentiment. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Thee, my hearts, are my beloved children and in all of thee,
                        I am so very proud.&rdquo;</span>

                        Ja-natia Cha-tain gave pause, with a mental nod, measuring and noting depth of heart of this cat. The eyes of all twelve cats squeezed closed, caught short by the unprecedented flattery from
                        their usually strict and formal teacher.

                        Chosen at birth from various families of cat in the three provinces of Iftmus, these young cats had all been brought to Pursong as kittens. The sanctuary school known as Seftora in the
                        Province of La-mor was an isolated glade, a sacred place that lay nestled between Gift-wa, the lake of silent waters and the river, Tears of Rensis. Here in Pursong, Seftora was the place
                        of learning, a sanctuary respected by all cat since the early days of the first ruling Sa-bata cats. Here in a vast area of beautiful trees and lush grass, dotted with yellow-green lich
                        moss, generations of cat were raised and taught by the Teacher to become Shi-kauti, keepers of Kylor. Here they learned the daily routines of living and survival, as well as being ingrained
                        with the histories, the laws, the lore and traditions of all cats of Iftmus. This was what bound all cat to one family. The sum of all cat experience was Kylor!

                        The place of testing, sat right on the Tears Of Rensis, river&#39;s edge. The poetic side of Fa-tera always reveled in the soothing song of the fast flowing water. The water whispered and laughed
                        over rocks. It cooed and swallowed itself in deep eddies. It was the teasing of tomorrow to the land that lay before it today. It was an echo of yesterday from the mountains and the heavens
                        from which it flowed.

                        The river, Tears of Rensis, swept in from the furthest boundaries of the three provinces and met in the middle of Iftmus at the bottomless falls of Fina&#39;sha, the singular place where the tip of
                        each of the provinces touched. Something stirred in Fa-tera&#39;s heart. She silently vowed to make a pilgrimage to those falls in the near future.

                        Nalas&#39;, the stone monoliths that surrounded the cats were a huddle of shadows from the past. The large stones were veined with greenstone and had been placed there by the Abyssinian cats
                        that once dwelt in La-mor. There was a peace to their presence, a tie with the past and the heritage of all cat. Only once an eight-season did they stir, as they had the so many sunwalks
                        before when Fa-tera had prepared for this testing.

                        Early sunwalk past, Fa-tera had entered Nalas&#39; from the riverside. The tall rocks shifted and grated within like the clearing of a stone throat. A group voice, many but one, spoke out
                        to her before she even faced the monoliths. &ldquo;Who&#46;&#46;&#46;, wakes&#46;&#46;&#46;, us?&rdquo; The voice was low and gritty like the rumbling of earth when stone caresses stone.

                        and threw out tiny, falling-star sparks that burned themselves out in multitudes of wishes before ever reaching the damp moss on the ground. Fa-tera added her own wish in among them. She
                        sighed as she looked proudly into the eyes of her children. She had raised them all, and she would now have to let them go. Why was it always, such a bite to the heart?

                        green eyes betrayed her part Abyssinian blood and turned a phosphorous glow. She nodded towards a large dry thornthistle branch, and with a flash that emanated first from her eyes,
                        the branch burst into flame. She had used that part of Sha-talon called Ma-hosta, &ldquo;fire of dreams&rdquo;. A crescendo of fire washed the clearing with renewed, warm light.

                        They relished encouragement and praise and like the Chaun, they seemed to have a limited understanding of Ma&#39;chona, &ldquo;Mindspeak.&rdquo; The Gindoo could hear but not mindspeak
                        back. They resembled the Pur-rocia that dwelt in the forests of Pa-tan, but unlike their ferocious cousins, the Gindoo were a smaller, more intelligent breed. The two extra limbs not
                        used for walking were ideal for carrying and moving things. Fa-tera had no qualms with their treatment here in Sefttora and other parts of La-mor, but she was uncomfortably aware of the

                        her children! For the first time in the Teacher&#39;s whole life she conceded she was old; she flinched. Admission did not make the fact any more palatable. The cat chuckled to herself
                        and quickly amended, &ldquo;Maybe not so much old as thee are just&#46;&#46;&#46; weary.&rdquo; She blinked. It was a tired that crept down into her bones and splashed back out in the
                        gray hairs that flecked her once shiny black coat. Again her head twitched and she laughed inwardly. &ldquo;What a portrait thee must portray.&rdquo; Truly, it was getting close to the
                        time for her to pass down the title of &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;. Pass it down to Ja-natia, just as Fa-sinto had passed it down to her, when she was his San-Tou, so many sunfalls ago. The

                        different part of Flow: the balance of all life and land in Iftmus. From it they drew Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus. Ma-chona, &ldquo;The whisper of Felis&rdquo; was mindspeak
                        and the Sa-bata cat had taught that. The Abyssinians touched a different part of Sha-talon; Ma-nasta, &ldquo;The weight of ages,&rdquo; which allowed them to move things by levitation.
                        Ma-hosta, &ldquo;The fire of dreams,&rdquo; allowed them to create fire as Fa-tera just had. Ma-chena, &ldquo;The steps of the wind,&rdquo allowed them to transport themselves or others
                        short distances. Up till now no other cat had ever mastered those aspects of the gifts. Eventually the Abyssinians moved up onto the Grasswater, separating themselves and any further

                        those cats just as private. Ja-natia herself had refused to be broached on the subject. What was the secret? What was more important than the truth of Kylor? How long were they to go on

                        There was one sad truth that stood out from wistful speculation. Since the Abyssinian cats had disappeared, there was an uneasiness seeping into the land, a feeling of wrong that refused
                        to be cast off. It was much like a damp fog sitting just footfalls ahead, always out of touch no matter how hard one tried to chase it down.  It was oppressive and it was only getting worse.

                        Kylor told how, earlier in Iftmus, most cats broke off into feuding prides and started claiming territories. Even Ren-sis could not bring order or caring back. Something vile had overshadowed
                        the land and was suffocating the spirit of every living thing.

                        A distant tremor caused the ground beneath her to tremble, adding its own voice to her worst suspicions.  As Nalas&#39; had said, Iftmus was in pain; the land and all that lived upon it were no
                        longer in harmony. There was no peace to be felt, only a vague sense of torment: a whisper-promise of impending doom. The worst part of all this was the gossamer fear-feeling she had long
                        cradled; a feeling that somewhere, something seemed to be enjoying all of this, taking sustenance like a kitten from its mother&#39;s teat. She could feel its consuming greed, its insatiable
                        hunger. It was a hunger that would not stop feeding till all life was sucked dry.

                        spiritual stumble, she was recognizing those doubts and in so doing, giving them a life of their own. From here on, the cat had no choice but to be haunted by the whispers of all she had,

                        shivered. Could this mean that past Shi-kauti had some part in placing insidious lies or half-truths into Kylor? She had to believe they couldn&#39;t. They were her adopted cubs, chosen,
                        raised, and tested, all so carefully. She was responsible for them, for Kylor, for all cats in Iftmus!

                        Cry-mar, down near the borders of La-mor and Pa-tan?  More questions with yet fewer answers. Why did the land itself feel so wrong? Why wasn&#39;t Kylor keeping up with even the local gossip?

                        past sunfalls, to bring up to date any changes or additions to Kylor. Occasionally a few had, in the past, missed Di-Chant due to traveling conditions or circumstances in their respected
                        province, but they would always show later. Four Shi-kauti had not shown up last Di-Chant or been heard from since.

                        The last verses were quietly mindspoken by Chi-kaw, a Lingst cat from the low hills in the southern portion of La-mor. He was a quiet, solitary cat with a troubled spirit.
                        Though he had no enemies here, throughout his training, it could certainly be said that he allowed few friends other than Fa-tera and Sa-toug&#39; the Shi-kauti he would
                        travel across La-mor with. Still he made up in fervor and faith what he lacked in social grace.

                        first brought to Sefttora as a cub.

                        Young Fa-tera had a reckless sense of adventure. She refused to stay where the old Teacher, Fa-sinto had directed the new cubs to play. Instead she had cautiously followed
                        the old cat. It was then she had seen her first and last Abyssinian ancestor, by virtue of her own partial blood. The Abyssinian&#39;s name had been Bastet, no larger than some
                        of the smaller cats residing in La-mor, but there was a majesty that emanated from her, a very power in her presence. Bastet&#39;s silver black fur was sleek and there was
                        a grace in her walk that made her look ageless.

                        Of the many things Fa-tera would remember, it was the Abyssinian&#39;s eyes that haunted her memories. Those eyes had been much greener than her own and they danced with a
                        fire that burned constantly and not just when the cat was using Sha-talon. It was a flood of green, alive, fighting with itself to keep from spilling out.

                        her gaze upon the young cat, there was only a warm wash of love that made the kitten want to return the same. Unbidden, Fa-tera stepped out from
                        behind the bush where she hid and walked slowly forward, sniffing, seeking mood, until the two cats were almost nose to nose.

                        little sister, thee and I will be seeing each other again.&rdquo;<span> The Abyssinian cat scrutinized Fa-tera even closer, a touch of magic reaching out
                        from her burning eyes. It snaked in and around Fa-tera&#39;s head and then returned from whence it came. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Yes&#46;&#46;&#46; yes my

                        thee are numbered.&rdquo;</span> There was a buzz&#46;&#46;&#46; a numbing of the mind that caused the rest of the words to slur. When Fa-tera shook her head
                        the old cat was smiling, almost sadly. She addressed her for the first time by name. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Fa-tera, thy blood is the blood of all cats,
                        even ours. Judge not harshly, for there are stories beneath stories, words behind words. Surely even the foolish wise cannot know them all!

                        There was melancholy to Bastet&#39;s strange benediction but as she turned and walked away, Fa-tera had no time to ponder it. Fa-sinto, her teacher had just
                        returned. Thinking she had been innocently pestering their guest he cuffed her lightly on the ear with a gentle swipe of his paw. <span class="italic"></span>
                        &ldquo;Go on nosy one. This is no business of yours. Go&#46;&#46;&#46; go join the others!&rdquo;</span> She scampered away not bothering to justify herself,

                        been an enigma. She alone, among all Ch&#39;aun, could Ma-chona &ldquo;mindspeak&rdquo;. This was a gift all cat of pure blood shared. Though mixed bloods could hear the
                        Ma-chona of other cats, they could not mindspeak back. They could not draw Ma-nasta, <span class="italic">&ldquo;The weight of the spirit&rdquo;</span>or Ma-hosta,
                        <span class="italic">&ldquo;The fire of dreams&rdquo;</span> or Ma-chena, <span class="itlaic">&ldquo;The trails of the wind&rdquo;</span> and thus came the abuse
                        nurtured by the ignorance and arrogance of most cat of pure blood. Ch&#39;aun were treated as lesser cat.

                        and the gindoo. It felt the perverting of Sha-talon and the abomination of cat drawing death blood of cat. It wept, as Ky-lor itself was found lacking and incomplete.
                        It swore at the desecration of the living land and life therein. There was no truth anymore; there was no sanity. There was no family of cat, for hatred and mistrust

                        settled toward the back of the cave, letting the mountain's breast cradle them from the sounds of the angry winds outside.

                        and disorganized to ever fall in behind one leader. As far back as is recorded, they have accomplished nothing but to remain petty warring tribes. Except for the few times
                        that someone was foolish enough to intrude upon their mountain lands, their fighting has always remained amongst themselves. March in force?&rdquo; He snorted,

                        both picked up some newly served ale and quietly drank the warm murky brew. The old dwarif finished his portion before his friend had even taken three short sips. He pushed

                       Samone didn&#39;t want to be here. He had left all this behind, bearing his own demons and now, suddenly he was forced to go back. Every step retraced his own sins and
                       he wasn&#39;t sure which was worse, the secret he was running from or the disaster he was running to. The bite of cold air was tinged with the faint scent of fear; he
                       wondered if anyone else could smell it?

                       take the edge off Samone&#39;s disposition. Several times the Dwarif cursed and muttered how real friends wouldn&#39;t inflict such hardship while taking such obvious pleasure
                       in the deed! Then with a renewed curse he would spur his mount to catch up with his laughing friend. Samone had traveled this road many times. It was strange how a path so
                       often traveled now felt so alien, so uncomfortable.

                        four as they walked miserably against the brutal wind rains. Both were too tired for idle conversation. Occasional thunder and heavy breathing were the only sounds that
                        interrupted the monotony of tired steps.

                        It was seven daca into the voyage. Mauldren and Sagof were below deck, brushing Lancon&#39;, when a disturbance, a crash and a curse, off in the dark hold, caused them both
                        to stop suddenly. A dirty, unshaven sailor, reeking of stelorno staggered through the hold, cursing the cabin boy for not paying attention to his daily duties. Given the
                        state he was in, and just having stumbled out of the dark into torchlight, he didn&#39;t see Mauldren standing to one side of his horse. The boy cringed; denying the
                        accusations and the sailor hauled off and backhanded him.

                        Mauldren felt his blood rage. Like a cat he leapt and tackled the drunk. Both of them tumbled over stacks of stores breaking the ties and boxes as well. If the sailor had
                        been sober, if he had been anything but a bully, if he&#39;d been a man and not a coward, he might have put up a fight. Meeting no resistance, Mauldren still beat him
                        unmercifully and would not have stopped if he had not heard Sagof whimpering in the distance.

                        Once anger subsided, sanity drew back in and Mauldren dragged the pathetic man across the hold and slamming him into the ramp, leading above-board. Rage washed in spit,
                        accompanied his words into the man&#39;s face. &ldquo;You had best pray, vermin, that this ship is big enough to keep you a stranger from myself and the boy for the rest
                        of this saken&#39; voyage!&rdquo; He threw the gasping head against the planks; letting fresh blood spill over old and punctuate the threat!

                       Some of the court and even a few of the lesser mages milling around, came up to greet Samone, but most greetings felt more of ceremony, as opposed to anything that resembled
                       heartfelt feelings over a long lost friend.  To those, the old Dwarif merely nodded politely and made small talk of the hard ride they endured and how a warmed wine would
                       certainly offset the wet and cold that still clung to them.

                       leaned towards Samone and whispered, &ldquo;It seems we&#46;&#46;&#46; nay, more likely you, are a matter of intrigue my friend. Or maybe they just can't bring

                        been absent a fair time, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, you left without much notice nor explanation before several important votes.&rdquo; He turned and surveyed the room
                        around them and sighed, &ldquo;Aye, but I too distrust people who can not look you in the eye and speak their minds.&rdquo;

                       Samone didn&#39;t have time to reply as a voice called out, echoing down the corridor. &ldquo;Do my own eyes deceive me?&rdquo; A tall woman, dressed in a black regal gown,
                       clinging desperately to her shapely body, spilled off below her knee to drape the floor as she walked towards them. Her dress was adorned with white jewels that were so
                       placed to depict three symbols of the Mage Crest, the three elements she had mastered thus far. Samone was almost sure she had only been wearing two when he had left three
                       spans ago. Her face and features were chiseled hard, but her statuesque beauty set her off from most women, relegating any comparisons well to her favor.

                       She was a long time friendly opponent of Samone, back when he himself had held the position for the briefest of time. Then and now, she was a force to be reckoned with

                       of it, &ldquo;&#46;&#46;&#46;with the passing of time?&rdquo; The First Mage scowled but nodded at his amended words. Samone continued, 7ldquo;I would think you would be

                       of admiration that, if anyone had the nerve to, might be interpreted as slightly romantic in nature.

                       silence for a moment, finally the tall regal woman smiled, turning back with a spark of warmth deep in her eyes. &ldquo;How are you my old friend, and without asking why

                       stomach with an over-exaggerated look of pain, &ldquo;Do guests at the Three Towers have to expire from thirst and hunger, or do you think the council coffers might

                       half of your request.&rdquo; Still smiling, she led them to a sitting room off the far end of the Hall of Commons. Trays of breads and fruits, decanters of mulled wines
                       and a shank of warm venison were just being brought out as Urista closed the single door behind them, shutting out the last of the gawking court. &ldquo;Well that should
                       give the busybodies something to keep their tongues waggling over for the next quarter span.&rdquo;

                       filching his first fresh-baked pie at a street fair.

                       The mercenary looked away quickly as she turned her gaze on him. When he looked up again she was smiling benignly and her eyes had gone expressionless. She motioned
                       them both over to an alcove dressed with soft high-backed chairs and a smaller marble table between them.

                       The First Mage slid back her chair, &ldquo;But first I must bid you both come with me.&rdquo; Urista rose in a fluid motion and they followed her through an ornate
                       bronze shielded door, rich with etchings of recounted battles from the Two Span War.

                       This took them into one of the adjoining meeting chambers, which Samone recognized was, in the past, a room set aside for visiting foreign dignitaries. &ldquo;There is
                       someone here I want you to meet&#46;&#46;&#46; someone who asked for you in particular Samone, when first she arrived this morn. Although I didn't anticipate it, it is

                       itself seemed to breathe and move to the eye. The grains  seemed to shift and paint a different pattern each time they were scrutinized.  The tall backed chairs were made
                       of the same, but the paddings were intricate embroideries dating back to Elvon arts. Those tapestries incorporated the wood frame upon which they were affixed until you
                       could not tell if the wood was not an anticipated part of the picture portrayed.

                       A large, walk-in fireplace framed in river burnished stone, burned a lazy fire that dressed the chamber in an exotic dance of shadows. The flames reflected off the four handcrafted

                       A rug barely peeked out from under the table and at the far end of that table and rug, lost in a large chair, sat a very small girl. In contrast and size she looked terribly
                       young, but her pointed ears and the ageless sparkle in her eyes immediately identified her as a full grown Sanchean Fayra from the Aleation Forests. She stood up as Urista
                       walked around the table, pointing back at Samone. &ldquo;Lere&#39;yll, this is Samone. Samone, Lere&#39;yll of the Sanchean&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo;

                       soft bells. Over and over she called him &lequo;Simi&rdquo; lavishing kisses on him that spoke of being more than mere friends. Despite the false impression, of an
                       incredible age difference, it was hard to ignore what their relationship appeared to be. Urista raised an eyebrow, while walking over. &ldquo;I assume you two have already
                       met?&rdquo;

                       Samone pushed the exuberant Fayra away from him, straightening his coat while blushing and clearing his throat. &ldquo;Yes we have.&rdquo; He winced, noticing the iced look
                       Urista shot him. &ldquo;I can explain you know!  Don't let her appearance fool you. Actually Urista, Lere&#39;yll here was&#46;&#46;&#46; several hundred spans old
                       before you were even born. We met about a hundred and twenty spans ago and&#46;&#46;&#46; we&#46;&#46;&#46; we were close for a span or so&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo;
                       he smiled at Lere&#39;yll and then quickly turned a serious face back at Urista. &ldquo;You must have read the old reports of when I was liaison&#46;&#46;&#46; by orders

                       him burst out laughing, until the door finally slapped a wooden hand over his mouth behind him.

                       well over fifty-thousand strong, are moving in three main groups, the larger in forward thrusts and two smaller flanking.&rdquo; She almost fell back into scowling at
                       Samone but stayed the better for the impulse. &ldquo;Their control seems to be divided amongst certain tribal leaders, a breed we&#39;ve never encountered before.

                       goblet as well for Samone. The old dwarif took it quickly, but the look he gave his friend indicated that the earlier issue was neither over nor forgiven. Mauldren stepped

                       constitutes murder and will not be tolerated! We have already dispatched one thousand Denrus warriors as the Council Legion to protect both tree and Sanchean Fayra from

                       Lere&#39;yll! Do not worry. Besides the Northland Mercenaries&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo; at which she nodded to Mauldren, and he with a bow back to her, &ldquo;&#46;&#46;&#46;
                       there is no force more determined or stronger than the Council Legion. None have ever prevailed against them, not even the brutal Elvon tribes combined. Already the

                       word &ldquo;child&rdquo; reminded her, she looked up at Samone and hissed softly, &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed old fool!&rdquo;

                       A commotion from the outer court interrupted his plea as someone forced entrance to the meeting chamber. All, but Mauldren startled as a bloodied trolya slammed back the
                       double brass doors and pushed his way past several court servants. Two Three Tower guards were demanding that the giant warrior wait to be announced, trying vainly to
                       bar his way.

                       dropping her voice, &ldquo;no doubt bringing news from the front. Allow him to enter!&rdquo; The order was redundant since the few guards on either side of the wounded
                       trolya, could do little to stop him. Most full grown Denrus Trolya stood seven forearms plus, with three hundred goldweight of muscle, making even Samone look, much like
                       a newborn.

                       the outland villages was, <span class="italic">&ldquo;Mind your Da and Mam, lest a Trolya get you in your sleep and swallow you in two bites.&rdquo;</span> Truth be-known,
                       Denrus Trolya were articulate and kept mostly to themselves unless aggravated. Of course when aggravated, it was simply a storm that had to take its own course!

                       forgetting for a moment to sheath his sword. How this Trolya was still alive and still breathing was beyond any reasoning. Gaping wounds to the bone flowed freely, and
                       even considering the short time in the room, he was already kneeling on more blood than floor. One massive hand looked to be holding in his intestines where he had
                       taken a swiping wound across the belly. Most of the wounds had worsened by virtue of the journey he had endured.

                       As the healer came into the room, the Trolya crumpled into a heap and stopped breathing.

                        eyes were fountainheads for the sweat of excitement that ran down his face.

                        It was high moon, yet up the hill past the market place, just before the palace gardens of Babylon, he could hear the distant screams of the dying and see the dull
                        reflection of flames that were the source of that beautiful noise. The air literally sang with blood sacrifice and though he had originally only planned for the destruction
                        of the A&#39;brean temple, he humbly offered these added deaths as tribute to his god Baushra&#39; and the new Shinghaut temple.

                        His church had taken root mostly in fear. At first he had offered suspected plague victims, which were all too willingly given and accepted. As the accusations spread
                        it became dissenters to the king. Political and religious radicals, intellectual dissidents, business rivals and soon he the Shinghaut Temple were receiving payments
                        attached to names all the way down to mere grudges.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        The new church rose with little grievance. The fact that the A&#39;brean Temple was the Kings Church made little difference any more. Merodach Balasu Ikbu was highly unpopular!
                        He knew the Shinghaut Temples had become too strong, too fast. The rich had no desire to be placed on the altars and therefore gave mightily in tithes and offerings.
                        With those, Aumerabi had built more temples and raised the Risha, his own temple army. They were brutal, well trained, well paid and arrogantly above any chance on the
                        altar. For it, the Risha soon rivaled Merodach&#39;s army and out of the king&#39;s own fear, were allowed their work for the church by the weak monarch.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Now Aumerabi smelled the panic and fear of those trying to run from his Risha. He would have gladly participated in the slaying of the infidels, from child to the feeble,
                        but as savior-leader of the Shinghaut religion, he was much too important to be taking on such risks. The lesser priests of his church were only too glad to shoulder
                        the task as long as it kept their own hides off the bloody alters.

                        The head priest turned with a shudder of ecstasy and strode down the dark corridors, passing his hand through the torch fires as he walked. His head was grotesquely
                        scarred, absent of all hair and eyebrows. The folds of his white robe hissed as his tiny frame scurried down the halls, chased by the echoes of his own thin footsteps.
                        Twenty acolytes followed a safe distance behind him afraid to incur his attention.

                        As he rounded the temple dais, several guards snapped from a lazy stance to attention. The nearer of these guards swung open the large bronze doors that lead into the
                        altar room, remaining on one knee, head bowed.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Aumerabi sidled away from him and through the doors. He didn&#39;t like to be touched. The phobia had spawned a tenant of the new faith. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Until
                        purged by the holy flames of Baushra&#39; none may touch perfection!&rdquo;</span>  The threat of flames would persuade converts, &ldauo;chosen&rdquo; to partake in the priest&#39;s
                        darker lusts. Then later those same flames would save their souls and insure their silence.

                        All must be purged, as Aumerabi had been, when palace troops had burned his village outside of Babylon to stop a plague from spreading to the city. As a child he and
                        his family had been pushed at spear point, back into a burning hut. The flames consumed his parents and sister and leapt hungrily at him.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        The priest sneered contemptuously at perpetrators long dead. Even now the flames avenged the past. By divine intervention he had been spared by the very roof that
                        fell on him, but only after the flames had purged him and made him a fit vessel for Baushra&#39;.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        Days later, priests had found the child burned beyond hope in the rubble. They didn&#39;t expect him to live but had taken him. with the expectation of imminent death.
                        For weeks he had to be gagged just to silence his painful screaming. Lost in the agony of his burns the child went quite mad. For even longer, on the borders of
                        madness and semi-consciousness he had experienced his visions and divine insights. In those days he had met his god and received instruction to bring down the
                        A&#39;brean Temple of the infidel king of Babylon, wresting from it the sacred Gildna Staff, the very staff that accompanied the accursed bitch priestess visiting
                        every harvest from the vile Temple of Bast in Egypt.

                        It had not been too hard to find a convert among the priestess&#39;s entourage. One such, Etoshia, had proven a valuable pawn and after many long years of recruiting
                        and planning, the Gildna Staff had indeed been wrested and now belonged to the Shinghaut Temple and the new god Baushra&#39;. Through the staff, Baushra&#39; spoke to
                        his servant Aumerabi Istaur.

                        Babylon and Egypt were failing empires. Without true faith they had grown weak and old. Already the new Persian Empire was bringing pressure to bear and it would not
                        be long before it swallowed them both up and spit out their dust. Aumerabi must combine the two ancient empires through this new religion, getting rid of the old weak
                        gods, bringing in a new strong order that was washed in blood and fire! The spindly, hairless man crossed in front of the altar table, running the tips of his bony
                        fingers through splashes of glistening red, from last hours sacrifice. Behind the altar, the Gildna staff glowed a sickly yellow/brown. It pulsed with the beat of the
                        priest&#39;s own heart.

                        Through the staff, Aumerabi could communicate, as well, with his disciples, Gamill Jamasta and Arutapha Emtu on Iftmus.  Bakala Achaemed and Mithra Ardashir on Axtoph.
                        These were the worlds that Baushra&#39; had led them to, as they continued the holy mission of their god&#39;s will.

                    <div class="prologue-text">
                        The priest laughed. What were two empires, when he was already crushing two worlds? With the power of Baushra&#39; it would come to pass. The cats still worshipped by
                        the foolish Egyptians in their Temple of Bast, had been stripped of most of their powers since the loss of the Gildna staff. The thought of those cats using his god&#39;s
                        staff to channel their own miserable powers made him shake visibly with rage. His god was only to be shared through him! Unless proper homage were paid to
                        both&#46;&#46;&#46; his god would be a god of wrath unlike ever experienced! Like a sexual shiver he could feel the death and destruction, taking place on each world as
                        he stroked the cold Gildna Staff.

                        The temple bell struck and Aumerabi forced himself out of his own thoughts. It was time to make ready for the next sacrifice. Each victim was dragged up the long hall.
                        They fought, they struggled and screamed, never knowing that their fear only made their blood more perfect for the giving. This was the chaos of death before its time!
                        This was what Baushra&#39; craved. Soon it would be the time for the birth of their new god. All living would bend to the will of Baushra&#39; or die in the fires of his
                        righteous anger!

                        Aumerabi walked slowly behind the vestibule where he would put on the sacred robes. The lesser priests were already filling the temple. The torches throbbed and flared
                        to the sound of their chants. The flames were struggling to break from their urns and run to meet the distant screams of the one being dragged down the hall. The Gildna
                        staff surged in yellow and gained strength as it absorbed the fear, fight and despair. Half carried they would plead and cry in vain while the trained use of the knife
                        increased the futile struggle to a crescendo and finally, fire purged and committed them to the arms of Baushra&#39;.

                        Fresh oil was poured on the stone alter. It would burn long after the screams of those who lay in it. Aumerabi looked towards the doors and heard the cries for mercy ever
                        closer. The hunched little man stopped chanting, long enough to smile.
