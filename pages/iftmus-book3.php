            <span class="large">A</span>n evil has been born and spreads over the failing Babylonian Empire in the land between the river Tigris and Euphrates. Nebuchadnezzar
            the II's successors are unpopular and already the power of the fast growing Persian Empire is threatening both the Babylonians and Egyptian Empires.
            It is a time of madness, a time of new Empires and new gods.

            <span>T</span>he Gildna Staff is an oracle of great power and many secrets. Stolen from the Egyptian Temple of Bast it is now kept in the Marduk Temple
            in Babylon. Used by the Shinghaut priests to communicate with the force they call Baushra&#39;, it has become the focus of worship fo the new and evil
            cult. The priests are reinitiating human blood sacrifice and planning the assassination of two kings in an effort to unite two failing empires as one
            force. This will in turn twart the invading Persians, plunging the world into war and inadvertently change the time line future of the coming Alexandrian
            Empire. In blood and suffereing they will change history and condemn the world to a new dark age.

            <span>I</span>n the name of this new, mad, dark god, the Shinghaut are perverting the balance and magic on each of the three worlds, setting the stage
            for the final unmaking of all creation. Already time has been tampered with, enough so to cease the existence of several of the nine heroes in thier own
            time, as well as destroying any home the others once had. One hero must relive the loss of her true love and not say a word else dooming them all. Another
            must claim his birthright, that of a fallible god, and in so doing must finally master the power that consumes not only him but also his companions; before
            that very power binds him to the mad god they fight.

            <span>L</span>ost in the intrigue and madness the question becomes,not only how the evil might be stopp3d, but even more ponderous, how do you set history
            back on its proper course, once it hs chosen a multitufe of paths that should never have existed? How to you reclaim your own birthright, a place in a future
            that now says, &ldquo;You no longer exit?&rdquo;
        </div>
        <div class="series-text-book-shadow">
            <span>T</span>here is no stopping or turning back. On each world, nothing remains as anything was. The only path ahead leads back to a world writhing in its
            own destruction. Iftmus, the only world where everything and everyone still exists. Thus fate dictates taht the finale that will be the confrontation, the
            final battle with the mad god Baushra&#39;!
