			<h3>1968</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					As a teen I lay on my bed and wept silently as much as any other depressed adolescent. I sighed while listening to albums of The Beach Boys, The Association and The Beatles.
					My High School love, despite my own sincerity at the time, was not in love as much as I was.<br><br>
					There is a world out there that demands the security of college degrees and corporate ladders. It searches for promises that lay far outside the soul of some people in question<br><br>
					This world has a total disdain for dreamers and their dreams. I will continue to write my songs and poetry, knowing I am on the wrong side of my &ldquo;first love&rdquo;&#46;&#46;&#46;
					&nbsp;and possibly many more lovers to come!

				<p>
					It&#39;s hard to leave the nest.<br.<br>
					I am amazed and alone. I no longer have my parents to rely on. I have no one I know of to count on. I am a stranger in a strange land. I was a child before this and now I
					am a child pretending to be a man.<br><br> 
					How can we not fail so many times when so ill-prepared?  Transition was never taught in High School!<br><br>
					Shame on our institutions!<br><br>
					I will find my place for I know my dream and though I have no idea how it will play out&#46;&#46;&#46; it will no doubt lead me to even further goals.

						I&#39;m going to be a father.  I have no idea what that means but there is a good feeling inside me. As scared as I am I treat it as my music. It&#39;s important and meant to be!

					My son was born today.  I don&#39;t know why fathers have to wait in the hall. He is beautiful and all I can do is look forward to the future with faith.

				<p>
					Christopher is barely old enough to talk yet through tears while pacing my deck he manages the words, &ldquo;Mommy has a home, my daddy has a home but I
					don&#39;t have a home.&rdquo; It ripped my heart out.<br><br> 
					Since his mom stole him back I have been told by the IRS I have to pay her debts or lose my car and equipment. For that I have to travel. I called Richard,
					his grandfather, and asked him to watch out for the little one. Besides not wanting to be a part of his torment I am forced to be absent.

					I have come to believe that every divorce decree should be started with the following words&#46;&#46;&#46; &ldquo;With total disregard for any and all vows and
					promises given before God and the company of man&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo;
				</p>

					The kind of pain we can never get used to is when we have given of ourselves, and our flesh is ruthlessly torn from our own bones; ripped away with all the
					mindless fury of an animal, as it seeks the heart and devours what it believes to be a deserved kill.<br.<br>
					We all start out in this life&#46;&#46;&#46; our first crush greeted with a nervous grin. Our first love is a warm flush of true, honest and sincere emotion.
					Soon we meet others with insecurity or what we have come to define as honest doubt. This goes on and on building walls around our hearts. Soon we are so calloused,
					with so little faith, that we treat others prejudged by our past.<br><br>
					I wrote a song with the line, &ldquo;And hearts don&#39;t break they only tear.&rdquo; Once torn, we only bleed until our soul mends or dies!

					I think I&#39;d rather be hungry than lonely. There are a variety of hungers that we act on daily. They drive us to achieve, to create, to move forward/backward yet
					persevere. Lonely does neither; rather it bids us to lie down, stop trying, give up and ultimately die.<br><br>
					We will all eventually die and though neither is preferred, I think I&#39;d rather be hungry than lonely. When it comes my soul&#46;&#46;&#46; I know I&#39;d rather be hungry!

				<p>
					My son will have to grow, with or without me. I&#39;m more sorry that he&#39;ll &ldquo;have to grow up&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;with or without me&rdquo;. My ex left
					no choice in the second part, and life leaves him little in the first. Right now he is God&#39;s favorite&#46;&#46;&#46; I wish he could remain as innocent.<br><br>
					But the mold has been twisted by the selfish; the flaws will show up in the future. Like the petal of a flower, too delicate to hold anything but the morning sun and dew.
					Someone walks up, picks up and crushes that flower between insensitive fingers exclaiming&#46;&#46;&#46; &ldquo;Look how beautiful!&rdquo;
				</p>
				<div class="entry-footer">
					<img src="../images/breakLine.png" width="150" height="25" alt="Break Line Image"/>				</div>
				<p>
					Life has a twisted sense of humor. I would give anything to see my son, rather than to feed money to my ex and the state. I am forced to travel rather than simply be with him.
					I see the scales of justice and there is no such thing for fathers of children. The world is beating its drum for women&#39;s rights with no time for the tears of a man. Everyone
					deserves the right to their children with no twisted boundaries of laws and barbed fences of bureaucracy to stop them!

					Back where I grew up, there was a tree that, to my childish eyes, stood miles above the clouds. Every branch took me further away from my antagonists, the bullies of the neighborhood
					and closer to my own spirit. At the top of that tree I would sit alone, breathing a peaceful moment of heaven.<br><br>
					Through older eyes, that same tree is merely a two story lonely sentinel that stands at the corner of a field, where I would guess, none ever venture any more.<br><br>
					To lengthen their runways the airport took hundreds of blocks of land and tore out all the homes and streets where I lived and grew up. After years I drove the border
					of what had been home. It was just a wilderness, with no way to distinguish any landmarks let alone a lone tree.<br.<br>
					We should never look back! Our older eyes will never see with the innocence they once did. Our hearts do not need the added pain of losing more of our most innocent and precious memories.

					Christopher is a year gone by now but I still remember when he was living with me.<br><br>
					He slips out of bed and allows me an hour more sleep while I lay there half-awake so as not to disturb his gift. Even in the summer he manages to reach the thermostat and
					challenge the outside sun to an inside battle. This is usually the signal for me to get up, open a few windows and find out if he&#39;s eaten too many cookies to allow a decent
					afternoon&#39;s breakfast.<br><br>
					On any given day I want to take him to the zoo or the park; and some days we do. More often, when I tell him to go outside and play; he knows I&#39;m going to write. Reluctantly, I
					have chosen, without knowing earlier, something he views as a rival.<br><br>
					Bedtime and a story come and hours later, the little monkey is, laying upside down with no covers on. He doesn&#39;t even wake as I rudely rearrange his sleeping habits.<br><br>
					I love him so much&#46;&#46;&#46; he gives me no choice!

				<p>
					So many dwell safe in a shell of ignorance, and so many people wish they&#39;d had never pecked through that shell.<br><br>
					I cried last night for myself. I wonder where that puts me?  It&#39;s like I was taking pity on a stranger.<br><br>
					It&#39;s Easter, Knowing Christ died for me, gave me inspiration and hope. To have someone care so much&#46;&#46;&#46; to know his tears were shed for our own redemption&#46;&#46;&#46; to know that God could
					love us so much&#46;&#46;&#46; in spite of ourselves!<br><br>
					When I write&#46;&#46;&#46; I sometimes know whose gift I am receiving!

					I watched my son playing baseball from the car yesterday. I won&#39;t go down to the field and put him through turmoil he went through as a young child. But it was nice to see him laugh, push 
					his cap back and wipe the sun out of his eyes.<br><br>
					I drove away wanting to cry but could only summon a reluctant smile.

			<h3>1975</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					I wonder when people are driving in their cars, blasting their radios instead of listening to their own thoughts. Are we so afraid of what we might hear if we spend any moments listen to ourselves?<br><br>
					The blithe, ignorant script of television, radio and movies only lend the gavel of a guilty verdict, proving that we sometimes prefer ignorance over the struggle for enlightenment.

			<h3>1976</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					We have started an album project thanks to a special friend&#39;s belief in us. I hope to repay that belief at least in some portion at some time.<br><br>
					It&#39;s strange, as an artist, when justification lies in others hands. We create and hope for instant gratification on all levels.<br><br>
					In truth, if we receive it, it is only diminished as the world demands their pound of flesh. Therein lies why most artists never see the light of day.<br><br>
					I can create like an assembly line. My shortcoming is I cannot hustle or try to sell myself. My pride is run over by the shortsightedness, the lack of insightfulness; the stupidity of those that dictate from &ldquo;above&rdquo;.
					At least that&#39;s the view from down here!

			<h3>1977</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					We finished the album and another friend offered us a time share apartment in the Hawaiian Islands. It was a great way to relieve the stress of the last year of constant recording and mixing.<br><br>
					For the first and only time I flew in a hang glider. For the first and only time I swam underwater with tanks. For the first and hopefully not the only time, I appreciated the beauty God has given us and the fragile world
					we have been given to care for. That gift, in itself, is soul worthy.

				<p>
					My son and I reconnected after way too long. We shot a BB gun from an upper deck porch. We had bacon and chocolate milk for dinner; his choice; might be a tradition for a while. Watched some shows on TV and will
					probably hit the market or the zoo tomorrow. There is a guard; a fence around him. He is too sincere that we are reconnecting&#46;&#46;&#46; no questions asked and for it, I don&#39;t believe the depth of his acceptance.
					This would be way too easy!

			<h3>1978</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					A lot of books, music and movies portray desperate lovers demanding that others acquiesce, for &ldquo;love will come in time.&rdquo;  If you find yourself in this situation run like hell for the only thing that will come in time,
					is apathy, anger, guilt, frustration, and a world of equally unrewarding emotions!<br><br>
					Insecure people settle for all of it&#46;&#46;&#46; in hopes of future security or in a desperate, last minute affirmation of ego. Don&#39;t chase someone who does not chase you back. Don&#39;t bully your way into a relationship
					with a litany of false hopes or promises.<br><br>
					If the bells don&#39;t sound for both of you, salvage your friendship and move on. If you cannot find the strength do so than the bells that toll later will be for the death of at least one of your spirits!  I should have
					known this before.

			<h3>1979</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					There&#39;s a trick to love. To find, to hold, to even feel it, we must be ready to put the other person first. In all things we must be willing to step back and let our partner not only state their case but in the
					presentation, preserve at least a good portion of it.<br><br>
					Now you know why true love is not all that common. We are, by nature, egotistical to the point of self-preservation. This is our lot in life. In truth, what we perceive as threat is, in reality, only a threat
					to our own perception.<br><br>
					If we put someone else first, we stand a far better chance that they will instinctively do the same for us. The trick is&#46;&#46;&#46; we cannot sell sincerity with a motive. If our motive is to be first, we must expect
					sincerity to come in last!

				<p>
					A walk on the beach can be anything from romantic to heartbreaking. It can be breathtaking to calming, inspiring to mood altering, or simply a spiritual moment to supersede all of the above.<br><br>
					My wish is to be cremated and left upon the waves of any beach. Our passing, is insignificant, yet we are still precious in the total picture, to some family and in the eyes of our God. Water is the source of
					life and certainly befits our passing to the next fountain of truth.<br><br>
					I for one appreciate being humbled one more time!

				<p>
					Genuine feelings require very few words to express themselves. They lie in a word, a phrase, a passage or the silence of a look. The depth of such feelings are more often weighed and measured by
					the actions that finally define them.<br><br>
					There are those souls who beat their chests and demand to be acknowledged. These people haven&#39;t evolved enough to warrant such acknowledgement.<br><br>
					It is far better to create a voice by our actions; those actions and that voice that will follow us like an echo into the next life!
