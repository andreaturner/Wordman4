            <br>
            <br>
            It is no secret&#46;&#46;&#46; it is a truth<br>

            Do not be blind to the season<br>
            For it will still fall upon you<br>

            Or turn your back upon it.

                <span>S</span>holama stood at the entrance to her father&#39;s lodge. Jamalok stayed off to the side as she hugged her father Nogastaw.  She was seven years passing
                and too soon to become a young woman. Jamalok watched them and wondered at her growth. Never had any Shaman accomplished what she had at such an age. He was proud
                and worried at the same time. She had lost some of her childhood and now was one of the most powerful persons on the land. She was still so young and though few
                believed it, her power was a narcotic, no different than any brew or smoke.

                <span>A</span>s she said goodbye, the bear yawned and rose on stiff joints. He was one thousand years old and then some. He growled and grumbled.
                <i>&ldquo;Is it not enough that the great Jamalok be forced to walk too many miles for his age? Yet who is here to bid him farewell?&rdquo;</i>&nbsp; The great bear
                rose up on hind legs. <i>&ldquo;Woe to the world who will someday say&#46;&#46;&#46; Whatever happened to the great Jamalok&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo;</i>

                <br>
                <span>S</span>holama walked over to the bear, who still stood three times her height. She elbowed him in the stomach. <i>&ldquo;Stop it foolish one. We all love you
                and will remember you. But this is not your time. We are going on a short expedition. It&#39;s not like we are going to the Horn of Heaven again.&rdquo;</i>
