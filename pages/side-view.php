                    Reflection on the past is a walk on a soft dirt path&#46; That dirt in places is dry beneath the sun of children&#39;s laughter&#46; We kick up whirlwinds of light hearted 
                    dust in rhythm to that laughter&#46; Or the dirt may be mud&#44; born of tears and regret&#59; a wet sand that clings and burdens our every step&#46; The path whispers to 
                    us along the way&#46; It questions&#44; affirms and condemns more often than leading us&#46; &#8220;The whispers&#8221; seem to believe&#44; if what we do what is right&#44; 
                    we need no affirmation&#46;It is expected that we feel in our heart the fulfillment of our soul&#46; We should never step back into the mud without question or an argument&#46;
