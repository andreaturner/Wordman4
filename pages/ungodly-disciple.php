            <p>(3 - 17) &ldquo;No part in any one soul can discern<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;a heart capable of gross betrayal;<br>
                Nor can we anticipate the callousness of the other soul,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;That has drunk itself so numb, as to allow it.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an evil that blindsides the trusting<br>
                and thrusts a knife into the heart of the innocent.

                </br>
                (3 - 18)  &ldquo;As the heart bleeds some do not die.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few that grow stronger<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few that grow wiser.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Still... there are the &ldquo;too many&rdquo;<br>
                That remain twisted and pass that legacy on!&rdquo;
