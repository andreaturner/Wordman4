            <em><strong>[C]</em></strong> I still re&#45;<strong><em>[Em]</em></strong>&#45;member&#8230; Those <strong><em>[F]</em></strong> pretty blue <strong><em>[G]</em></strong> eyes<br>
            That soft southern accent&#8230; Those nights that we cried<br>
            <em><strong>[Em]</em></strong> High school by day but the night <em><strong>[F]</em></strong> held its own reward <em><strong>[Fm]</em></strong><br>
            Making love in the back of a &#39;57 Ford<br><br>

            You were my first love&#8230; Sometimes I think my last<br>
            I still remember&#8230; Although those days are past<br>
            You won't have trouble recalling that old familiar chord<br>
            Making love in the back of a &#39;57 Ford<br><br>

            Dark steamy skyline&#8230; Passion in the air<br>
            A song by the Beatles<br>
            &#39;Bout a man they called nowhere<br>
            All of our innocence falling a swift two-sided sword<br>
            Making love in the back of a &#39;57 Ford<br><br>

            <em><strong>[F]</em></strong> I still re&#45;<em><strong>[Em]</em></strong>&#45;member the <em><strong>[F]</em></strong> promises we <em><strong>[G]</em></strong> made<br>
            We knew it all then but look at us today<br>
            You&#39;re raisin&#39; children&#8230; And I&#39;m raisin&#39; hell<br>
            You got your family&#8230; I got my music to sell<br>
            Still the sweetest song I can think of&#8230; or ever record<br>
            Is making love in the back of a &#39;57 Ford<br><br>

            But look at us today<br>
            <em><strong>[D]</em></strong> You're raisin' <em><strong>[F&#35;m]</em></strong> children and <em><strong>[G]</em></strong> I'm raisin' <em><strong>[A]</em></strong> hell<br>
            You got your family I got my music to sell<br>
            Still the <em><strong>[F&#35;m]</em></strong> sweetest song I could think of&#8230; or <em><strong>[G]</em></strong> ever re&#45;<em><strong>[Gaug]</em></strong>&#45;cord<br>
            Is making love in the back of a &#39;57 Ford<br>
