						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Abyssinian Cat</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Ab-ah-sin-ee-an)</span> This cat was of the smaller breeds, small boned and sleek. Born in the area that would later become the province of
							La-mor they were the first to control and treat Sha-talon, the magic&#39;s of Iftmus, as an art.   They separated themselves from all other
							cats to reside at Greensun and it was then that the Cha-tain cat closed off the larger portion of the Grasswater and allowed no other cat
							to trespass it. Since then, little more is known about the Abyssinians. The last entry into Kylor of their disappearance was the fact that
							they totally vanished almost within a single Sunfall with no message nor explanation. The Cha-tain make no comment of it other than to
							affirm the Abyssinians are indeed gone.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Acca Trees</dt>
						<dd>
							A Birch like tree that sheds it&#39;s white bark twice a season.  When chewed during religious festivals on Iftmus, cats use the hallucinogenic
							properties of the bark to meditate and commune with the Spirit of Felis.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Araupaso</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Ah-rap-ah-sue)</span> A breed of horse on Axtoph existing only on the Northland Plains. The Northland Mercenaries lay sole claim to the horse
							and protect that religiously.  An Araupaso, is known for its strength and endurance and it&#39;s longevity, living for thirty to forty spans.
							Unknown to all but the Northland Mercenaries the Araupaso possesses the ability to communicate within its own breed making it a sentient life
							form. This is not an animal that is owned. If any are allowed to ride one, it is only by consent of the horse.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Chafi&#39;</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Chafee)</span> A high protein sugar melon believed to have been cultivated within the confines of Greensun and presently flourishing in the lo-hils
							of both the Pri-hy and Saber-sha Mountains in Iftmus.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Ch&#39;aun</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Chawn)</span> Those cat on Iftmus of mixed blood resulting from to unaccepted cross breeding. These cats have no status and are allowed no
							title nor name other than to be called a Ch&#39;aun. Treated as misfits in Iftmus they either die from the lack of belonging to a pride or flee to the Grasswater seeking
							the fabled sanctuary, Greensun. 
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Cha-tain Cat</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Cha-tang)</span> Much like the Cheetah in speed this larger, pure white cat has long flowing fur that blows like the tall grass they hunt in.
							They are the only breed of cat living on the Grasswater of Iftmus and are rumored to have once served the Abyssinian cat. They tolerate no other cat in their domain
							though many believe that they now allow the Ch&#39;aun cat, sanctuary through the Grasswater to seek and find refuge at Greensun. Due to their isolation little more is
							known about them. The Shi-kauti that bring Ky-lor to the Cha-tain are strangely quiet about any of their secrets and ways.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Gindoo</dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(G-in-dew)</span> Small apelike creatures on Iftmus on the level of a domestic pet or slave. The Gindoo have a limited understanding of basic

						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(G-rag-mew)</span> Deer size mountain goats living on the slopes of both the Pri-hy mountains in Pa-tan and the Saber-wa mountains on the

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Harkensong</dt> 
						<dd>
							A large flamingo type bird on Iftmus that keeps to the air unless nesting in the high cliff areas. It sings to its mate in flight and for the most part is nocturnal.
							It&#39;s song has created catlore that says &ldquo;The wandering bird,  carrying it&#39;s lament across the lonely night skies shall remind all cat to listen to the land, for
							Iftmus speaks even when none might hear&rdquo;. A lesser-known proverb calls it &ldquo;the voice of all cats that have died violently crying out for home&rdquo;.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Jum-Hopper</dt> 
						<dd>
							On Iftmus this is a gray and white stripped creature about three feet tall, very affectionate but deadly with it&#39;s front short paws. It can jump high or long but cannot

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Ka-tem</dt> 
						<dd>
							A breed of cat much like a mountain lion but vaguely reminiscent of a small version of the Saber tooth cats who first ruled Iftmus, probably due more to the small fangs that

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Las&#39;trea</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Lass-tree-ah)</span> A bird, turkey size whose wings cannot support the body for flight. Instead they help it run faster taking leaps. Abundant in the

						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Li-Horan Cat</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(La-hore-ann)</span> This lion-like breed has been the ruling cat in Iftmus since the passing on of the Sa-bata cat as a race. It was during the
							latter part of their rule that cat began drawn the deathblood of cat. The strength of their rule, even in the face of such abomination is that they are supported by
							the Ti-breen cat, another larger cat more militia minded, but more important, the Pan-duran cat with their magic&#39;s. Since the Cha-tain keep to their Grasswater and
							have no active interest in the politics of Iftmus, there is none to challenge the Li-horan rule.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Lich&#39; Moss</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Like-Moss)</span> A soft yellow green carpet type found mostly in the province of La-mor on Iftmus.  An evergreen with the exception of a short period

							<span class="italic">(Ming-st-how Go-blee-ah)</span> Named after the mountains they live in on Axtoph, these are barbaric tribes of half human half apelike creatures that  divided
							into squabbling tribes whose inner conflicts have always kept them from being any threat to other races. Extremely vicious and cannibalistic by nature. They are by virtue of
							numbers, if ever organized, a force to be reckoned with.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Mud-Waump</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Mud Wamp)</span> This animal resides in all three provinces of Iftmus.  Makes its home around the lakes and swamps.  It is three times the size of a beaver and
							deadly if approached in the water.  Outside of the water it is totally helpless and another food source for the cats.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Nashanti</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Nah-shaun-tay)</span> Religious fanatics on Iftmus made up of various breeds of cat that reside at Fina&#39;sha the center falls at the border of all three

							the spirit of Felis.

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Pan-duran Cat</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Pan-dur-in)</span> This cat would most resemble a black panther though larger and more shaggy. They claim to be legitimate heirs to "Sha-talon" on
							Iftmus and barely tolerate all other breeds, including the now ruling Li-horan cat.  Their perversion of the original Sha-talon is noted but not spoken of openly by most cat.
							They have withdrawn themselves to a citadel called Amas&#39;ka in the Pri-hy Mountains in the province of Pa-tan. No cat is allowed there and few have ever returned if summoned.
							It is the one place besides Greensun, in Iftmus, that bars even the Shi-kauti from entering.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Photoke</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Fo-toke)</span> Plant vine that grows on Axtoph  similar to Tem-bata on Iftmus used to control seizures.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Pinesca</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(P-ness-ka)</span> A yellow green snake growing often to twenty or thirty feet in length and over a foot in diameter. It lays its eggs in the
							shallow water regions of the lakes on Iftmus.  Fast in the water it is more than slow moving on land, crushing its victim and then injecting it with a venom that decomposes its
							flesh. This makes the prey deadly and offensive to other animals while allowing the snake to leave it and come back later at its leisure to eat.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Purocia</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Purr-row-see-ah)</span> Related to the small chimpanzee like Gindoo on Iftmus, these ferocious cousins are five feet of muscle with violent tempers and are

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Stank Flies</dt> 
						<dd>

							but their ability to attack as an organized swarm.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Tanka Root</dt> 
						<dd>
							<span class="italic">(Tang-kah)</span> A root harvested by the Sanchean Fayra on Axtoph that is their confectionery substitute for sweets. Its facsimile on Iftmus has similar taste and texture but

						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Windtalkers</dt> 
						<dd>Trees common to the province of La-mor in Iftmus. Profuse around the Takinta Glade near Pursong these trees produce leaves that have stiff spines. When they rub together in the wind the leaves produce
