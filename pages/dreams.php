                    despite our most sincere efforts to hold onto our own sweet perceptions&#46;<br>

                    Finally there is a subtle distant light that if we are looking for it&#44;<br>

                    the hard tile under the scrutiny of harsh fluorescent lights&#46; He convulses for several minutes and&#44; in time&#44; wakes up to the confusion of his first epileptic seizure&#46;
