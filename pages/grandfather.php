                    My grandfather was a peaceful man&#46; As a boy sitting on his lap&#44; I remember the rare sparkling eyes and husky laugh that transcended 
                    the usual gruff exterior&#46; His life had been the struggle of an immigrant&#44; coming to this country in search of peace&#44; wanting only a 
                    place where he and his wife might raise their children in freedom&#44; something&#44; up until then&#44; they had never before experienced&#46;

                    All through the hardships of starting this new life&#44; his &#34;peace&#34; was always linked to God through the worn German Bible that always sat by 
                    his favorite chair&#46; Over the years the portrait remained the same&#46; A man content&#44; despite the struggle&#44; committed to work hard for his place 
                    in a new country&#44; as well as his place with his God&#46; Then&#44; drastically the portrait was altered one fateful&#44; tragic day&#46;

                    After his retirement&#44; at an age where he no longer felt confident behind a steering wheel&#44; he had decided to run a few last errands&#44; the final one 
                    being to mail in his license and retire the car. On that day&#44; all but the last errand completed&#44; he fatally struck a child who had run out from 
                    between parked cars into the street&#46;

                    Never reconciling himself to the tragedy&#44; he died about a year later&#44; stripped of any of the peace that had been his comfort through the years. In his 
                    mind, God had become an angry stranger&#44; punishing him for something that was beyond his comprehension&#46; In his words, <span class="italic">&#34;This 
                    does not happen to good people. I&#39;ve done something in my life to make God angry with me&#46; I don't know what, but I do know that God does not let this 
                    happen to someone he loves&#33;&#34;</span>

                    A year of tears&#44; a year of an untouched Bible&#44; a year of an &#8220;un-forgiven&#8221; guilt&#44; and indeed&#44; God did become a stranger&#46; My 
                    Grandfather's death was anything but peaceful&#46; I had started to write this as a letter to him while he was in the hospital on the verge of death. He was 
                    so afraid to go meet this &#34;angry&#34; God&#46; He died before it was finished and I could deliver it to him. Instead, I was asked to read it at the 
                    funeral as his eulogy&#46;
