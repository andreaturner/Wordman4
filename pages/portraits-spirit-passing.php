                    Maybe it was part of the punishment that my father considered it his duty to place me in a leaky wooden boat at least three times a year and expose the both of us to the worst elements of 
                    rain&#44; wind and sun so that we could suffer and watch everyone else around us catch fish&#46;

                    My father and I went out after trout on every lake in the county&#46; In the  dark hours we would arise and place a wooden monstrosity of a rowboat upon the top of the car&#46; The fog 
                    would cling to us like a jealous lover saying don&#39;t go&#8230; I can keep you wet and cold right here&#46; You know what isn&#39;t going to happen out there on the lake&#46; And for 
                    all the fish we never caught&#44; all the water we had to bail&#8230; the fog had spoken the truth&#46;

                    We went after salmon up and down Puget Sound&#46; There my dad had to finally give up using oars to troll&#46; He rented a motor begrudgingly while muttering under his breath that the 
                    rental fee was an affront to nature and merely the ferryman&#39;s toll to reach the distant shores of hell&#46;

                   We had the latest lures&#59; the newest poles and our tackle boxes contained enough extra everything that we could&#39;ve outfitted ten more fishermen had they come aboard our 8&#45;foot 
                   wooden yacht&#46;

                   The weather was never accommodating&#46; The rain would hold off until we were too far from shore to turn back&#46; The boat no matter how we treated it sustained a two inch layer of water 
                   on its&#39; floor&#44; as if an offering to cool our temperament when we came back empty handed again&#46;

                   Still there was simplicity to life then&#44; though I often wonder how, according to today&#39;s standards&#44; we ever survived it&#46;
