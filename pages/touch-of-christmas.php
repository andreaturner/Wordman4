        	<em><strong>[Cmaj7</strong> Amaj7 bar<strong>]</strong></em> It was late Christmas eve&#8230; or day to be fair<br>
        	Every <em><strong>[Bbmaj7</strong> Amaj7 &#189; step no bar<strong>]</strong></em> bar in the town &#39;cept for one were all closed<br>
        	Down by <strong><em>[Dm]</em></strong> Pioneer </strong><em>[G]</em></strong> Square<br>
        	It was Hannigan&#39;s Brew&#8230; but the owner was Bill<br>
        	He was open all night &#39;cause for some it was home<br>
        	&#39;Gainst a cold alley&#39;s chill<br>
        	And he <strong><em>[Am]</em></strong> wanted to <strong><em>[G]</em></strong> do what he could<br>
        	He was needed and it made him feel good<br>
        	And it was special&#8230; Just <strong><em>[F]</em></strong> a small touch <strong><em>[G]</em></strong> of Christmas<br><br>

        	Then Jimmy walked in&#8230; he was &#39;bout sixty&#45;four<br>
        	With a Santa Claus suit that heâ€™d worn for three weeks<br>
        	At a department store<br>
        	&ldquo;How&#39;s it goin&#39; Bill&#8230; how &#39;bout a beer&#63;<br>
        	All the kids have gone home <br>
        	and I guess that that&#39;s that<br>
        	For another long year&rdquo;<br>
        	And he wanted to do what he could<br>
        	He was needed and it made him feel good<br>
        	And it was special just a small touch of Christmas<br><br>

        	Jimmy sat at the bar&#8230; he said &ldquo;you&#39;ve always been<br>
        	Like a brother to me Bill you know I feel like<br>
        	You&#39;re my closest friend&rdquo;<br>
        	Bill set down two beers said &ldquo;this one&#39;s on me&rdquo;<br>
        	And they both gave a smile there was no other place<br>
        	They would rather be<br>
        	And between them a gift was exchanged<br>
        	It was God&#39;s love and it needed no name<br>
        	And it was special just a small touch of Christmas<br>
