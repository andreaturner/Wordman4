                continue to pour out of their mountain holds, and with an unexpected ally march across the Da-ton&#39; Empire towards the queen city Elbron, where

                of the Willaward lies in the souls it possesses; the very souls of the Elvon race that created it. Elvon warlords and their dragons return from another
                dimension to Axtoph, only to find that their whole Elvon race was decimated in the Two Span War. The Willaward now has the equivalent power of every
                slaughtered soul and is possessed by the anger of that whole annihilated race.
