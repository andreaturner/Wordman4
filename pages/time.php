            She stood upon the sands of her own shore&#44; her spirit questioning out&#46;<br>
            &#8220;I know not whether to laugh or cry over the passing of time&#33;&#8221;<br>
            The quiet water gently beckoned while the night stars shimmered&#59;<br>
            the eyes of Angels upon her&#44; and a voice whispered to her heart alone&#58;

            Time is the kiss of wind upon our cheek<br>
            And though we would bravely turn to face it<br>
            Already it is gone&#46;<br>
            Still&#44; a trace of its passing presence<br>
            Lingers upon each of us&#44;<br>
            Etched upon our flesh&#44;<br>
            even molded onto our very souls&#46;<br><br>

            Often&#44; time meets us as a lover&#44;<br>
            a friend for the sharing&#46;<br>
            In other moments it is guised as an assailant&#46;<br>
            We alone determine its mood&#46;<br>
            We alone decide which gifts we shall take<br>
            from this most fleeting lover&#46;<br><br>

            Gaze upon your own reflection<br>
            And see the myriad faces<br>
            that are&#44; in truth&#44; those days past&#59;<br>
            The very consorts you summoned&#46;<br>
            Each moment&#8230; friend and foe&#59;<br>
            every day&#44; both lover and antagonist&#46;<br><br>

            Though the years quietly sculpt us in passion<br>
            And blind inspiration, take heart&#8230;<br>
            Surely the hand of God is quietly at work&#44;<br>
            If only out of love<br>
            for His most precious child&#46;<br>
