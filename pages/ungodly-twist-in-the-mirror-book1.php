                    scholar for the church and not just a runner.

                    <span class="large">I</span>t is the third night of &ldquo;The Abacus&rdquo;; the mourning for the lost Saints. I am running between the second and the seventh temple. When I meet Vosaud,
                    he is like a storm standing right outside arms reach. Actually I don&#39;t meet him&#46;&#46;&#46; as much as he saves my life. Our initial introduction is on the very night of his escape
                    from imprisonment and torture. The scrolls I carry will later prove to be the transcripts and the declarations of his accused heresy.

                    <span class="large">A</span> drunken group of four, step out from the shadows confronting me. They reek of ale, which is only overpowered by the lack of their own personal hygiene. I
                    believe they are only after coin, but since I have none, they seek to collect instead with mindless violence. I am kicked and stomped beyond counting and it would have most assuredly increased
                    until my passing, had not a voice spoke out from the dark. That voice is made all the more ominous being accompanied by a bruised, bloodied figure wrapped in thin layers of fog.

                    <span class="large">&ldquo;A</span>re you animals without reason or compassion, or are you only such cowards that it takes four of you to prevail against one?&rdquo; They look at the questioning
                    figure, as if weighing his worth to mine.

                    he pulls a sword. His eyes smolder and the wounds on his flesh glisten in barely dried blood. &ldquo;Now you should give pause and contemplate your mortality. Do you wish this to be the last night
                    you breathe air&#46;&#46;&#46; or do you still retain enough wisdom to turn and leave, that you may breathe a few more nights to come?&rdquo;

                    shoulders in a return whirl and the &ldquo;Ungodly Disciple&rdquo; looks at the rest of them with contempt. &ldquo;It seems you can only prevail against the weak or unarmed! You are less than dogs and tonight you will
                    all meet your Maker!&rdquo;

                    knife finds its way, with silent accuracy, to his throat. There is no scream, no denial, only quiet acceptance with a trace of disbelief.

                    sheath as he shakes his head with a sigh, &ldquo;Sometimes it makes no sense to seek retaliation against stupidity.&rdquo;
