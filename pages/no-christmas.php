						  Mr. B.E.R was not a dumb bear! In fact, truly he considered himself rather smart and quick of wit. The way he saw it, his only problem
						  was that he was a &ldquo;fairly new bear.&rdquo; Why, barely a few days had gone by since the last stitch in his brown fur had been pulled tight.
						  Because he was fairly new, <span class="italic">(he liked the term &ldquo;fairly new&rdquo; because it made him feel older than if he called himself
						  &ldquo;brand new&rdquo;)</span>, he had a lot of questions that sometimes came out sounding perhaps, a little&#46;&#46;&#46;  dumb?
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  One particular winters night when the toy store was long closed and quiet and all the toys had gathered around for their midnight talk he asked, &ldquo;
						  I can see where Christmas is certainly a pretty time&#46;&#46;&#46;&rdquo;, pointing a stubby paw at some of the holiday decorations hanging around
						  the quiet toy store. &ldquo;But&#46;&#46;&#46; what exactly is Christmas?&rdquo;
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  The Jack-In-The-Box broke into a peal of cruel laughter. He bobbed in and around Mr. B.E.R. making the little bear feel dizzy and just a little bit wobbly.
						  &ldquo;What is Christmas? What is Christmas? Hey did you hear that everybody? Tubby here wants to know what Christmas is!&rdquo;
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  Now Mr. B.E.R. considered himself to be a pretty easy going bear, still, he never did like Jack, especially when the mean clown cackled cruel insults.
						  The smile on Jack&#39;s clown face was painted and hard and it never did seem like a real smile.
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  He was always poking fun at Mr. B.E.R. or Snookie the Singing Squirrel and many of the other smaller toys. 
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  Mr. B.E.R. growled lightly and rubbed a paw over his fuzzy tummy. He didn&#39;t feel like a tubby! He felt&#46;&#46;&#46; well packed with maybe just
						  the right touch of <span class="italaic">fluffy</span>!
					 </div>
					 <div class="series-text-children">
						  &ldquo;Maybe I should just go over there and bite his head off!7rdquo; But he didn&#39;t because cause deep down inside Mr. B.E.R. considered himself to
						  be a fairly peaceful bear. And anyway, the thought of biting Jack made him feel queasy. He shook the thought off with a quiet whine and tried to focus in
						  on what Sarge was saying.
