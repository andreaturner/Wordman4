                and slow realizations of the 60&#39;s. Like all of us we think our time was the best. I was timid and unsure but my heritage demanded I
                pick my lot in life and pursue it with a passion.

                I suppose I should have had the decency to blush.

                <span class="large">D</span>uring that time I discovered another outlet that intrigued me. I studied the words and music of the folk & rock genre. I taught
                myself guitar by removing all the strings and putting them back on, two at a time. Discerning which combination of fret positions sounded
                pleasant, I would then add two more strings. When done, I had finally formed chords; no clue as to what they were called until I started interacting
                with other musicians. From then on I was writing my own original music. It was a rewarding time when people cared and listened. I played local bars and made a fair living.

                across the country, up and down the West Coast, inward to the Midwest and Southwest and finally ending up on the East Coast, I am once again home; residing in
                the Pacific Northwest.

                I am now winding down the traveling/performing aspect of music while recording my own songs in my home studio; smooth jazz instrumental versions of my
                varied compositions. I&#39;ve since redirected my focus on my writings and my passion for photography.

                this is a good thing since, by then, I was a sputtering candle. She tells me that she is my souvenir from the East Coast and while I have to agree, I include Lesley as a
                force in this final endeavor in my life; she always refused to allow me to accept anything less than my best which she is&#33;
