						  <span class="italic">This story dedicated to<br>
						  Reese Koch, our first grandson,<br>
						  Still early in the womb.<br>
						  I wrote this Reese&#46;&#46;&#46; before you were conceived.<br>
						  I dedicate it to you before you took your first breath.<br>
						  You were and are, an anticipated joy, a gift&#46;&#46;&#46;<br>
						  And I&#39;m sure you will be a match<br>
						  For any monster there under your bed!

					 <div class="series-text-monster">
						  It started for me,<br>
						  Oh&#46;&#46;&#46; I must have been three,<br>
						  Those nights lying in bed trying to sleep.<br>
						  Tucked in at my toes,<br>
						  Blanket pulled to my nose,<br>
						  Fingers clutching and holding my sheet.
						  <br><br>
						  It was hard to be brave<br>
						  But my parents would say<br>
						  &ldquo;Don&#39;t be silly it&#39;s all in your head!&rdquo;<br>
						  But I knew it was true<br>
						  As you might know too it was,<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  No matter what they would say<br>
						  The sounds gave it away<br>
						  As I lay there alone in the dark.<br>
						  There were crackles and thumps<br>
						  And whooshes and bumps<br>
						  Not to mention my own pounding heart.<br>
						  <br>
						  Scared to the bone<br>
						  I would lay there alone<br>
						  And at times with my kitty named Fred.<br>
						  Wishing he&#39;d be<br>
						  A tiger for me, &#39;gainst<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  It&#39;s true what they say<br>
						  Things don&#39;t go away<br>
						  Just because you are shutting your eyes.<br>
						  I&#39;m sure I was dreaming<br>
						  Those times I was screaming<br>
						  &#39;Cause brave kids we try not to cry.<br>
						  <br>
						  In the dark shadowed night<br>
						  With barely no light<br>
						  Covered up to the eyes in my head.<br>
						  I could plug both my ears<br>
						  But still I would hear<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  Oh my monster was smart<br>
						  And I knew in my heart<br>
						  That I&#39;d never convince anyone.<br>
						  So I&#39;d lay there and shiver<br>
						  And sweat like a river<br>
						  Wanting to cry out or run.<br>
						  <br>
						  Kisses and hugs,<br>
						  Pleasant dreams and goodnight<br>
						  Couldn&#39;t save me, I knew that instead,<br>
						  It came down to me<br>
						  All alone in the dark, with<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  By the time I reached four<br>
						  I decided no more<br>
						  This monster and I&#39;ll have it out!<br>
						  Oh you would have been proud<br>
						  To be part of the crowd,<br>
						  Cheering my bravery no doubt.<br>
						  <br>
						  With my old plastic bat<br>
						  And a flashlight at that<br>
						  My plan now was moving ahead.<br>
						  I would creep slowly &#39;round<br>
						  Indeed, hunt it right down,<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  The full moon was bright<br>
						  Through the window that night<br>
						  As the shadows of tree branches waved.<br>
						  Spurring me on<br>
						  Saying &ldquo;Let it be done,<br>
						  This is it, go ahead now be brave.&rdquo;<br>
						  <br>
						  The noises were there,<br>
						  And at first I was scared,<br>
						  But I gulped and I swallowed my dread.<br>
						  &ldquo;Have it out!&rdquo; was the call<br>
						  &ldquo;End it once and for all!.&rdquo; with<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  Slowly I crept<br>
						  To the foot of my bed,<br>
						  Trying not to make any sound.<br>
						  If there could just be<br>
						  A hundred more me&#39;s,<br>
						  Maybe then we could all<br>
						  Just surround it.<br>
						  <br>
						  The bed seemed to loom<br>
						  In that dark scary room,<br>
						  Whatever got into my head?<br>
						  Only fools would suggest<br>
						  That you go on a quest for<br>
						  <span class="large-120">The Monster</span><br>
						  <span class="large-120">There Under My Bed.</span>
						  <br><br>
						  But I couldn&#39;t stop<br>
						  As much as I wished<br>
						  That I could, it was all just too late.<br>
						  The monster was stirring<br>
						  No doubt it was luring<br>
						  Me onward now; on toward my fate.<br>
						  <br>
						  My mouth was so dry<br>
						  Why this might be goodbye,<br>
						  At my funeral would these words be read?<br>
						  <span class="italic">&ldquo;This child was a hero<br>
						  Who acted to save us!&rdquo; from</span><br>
						  <span class="bold">The monster there under my bed.</span><br>
						  <br>
						  I threw back the cover<br>
						  And there did discover<br>
						  The monster there under my bed&#46;&#46;&#46;<br>
						  Was none other than,<br>
						  And probably always had been,<br>
						  My own little kitty named Fred!<br>

						  If any wind could be jealous, then without a doubt this certain little breeze would be among the many to claim such feelings. On a feather soft
						  autumn day it ravaged newly raked leaf piles with imaginings of great strength, as if lifting the waves of a mighty ocean and tossing them every
						  direction. It would blow against the stubborn flowers, bending them, even as bigger winds would bend supple trees. But alas, every daydream was ever
						  shattered by the sounds of people laughing while lifting their collars against the little breeze&#39;s face. Even the delighted screams of children, as
						  they watched their kites soar and bob, seemed to mock its wishful thinking.
					 </div>
					 
					 <div class="prologue-text">
						  All of this was so hard for the little breeze to bear. <span class="italic">&ldquo;Why can't I,&rdquo;</span> it would breathe, <span class="italic">&ldquo;
						  Why can't I be like the mighty wind who can turn the face of the strongest and ice the heart of the bravest? For if that were so, I would do more than
						  just rattle windows and bend river reeds that stood in my way! But alas,&rdquo;</span> it would sadly say, <span class="italic">&ldquo;a breeze is just a
						  breeze.&rdquo;</span> and so try to content itself with leaves and small bits of paper, tossed so casually aside by the bigger winds.
