                <span class="large">W</span>olf was just a pup when the snow took her mother. It swept over them from the god of a mountain above. It took her brothers and sisters as well.
                In less than the blink of an eye, wolf was an orphan!

            <div class="series-text-book-axtoph">
                <span class="large">T</span>he pup tramped through the deep snow for hours whining, searching for the scent of anything familiar. The winds howled and the mountain stood there in cold denial.
                The skies rained cold and the heavens wept ice.

                <span class="large">F</span>inally the young one stumbled off, seeking some shelter from the bite of cold. She had learned at least that much in her too few months. Wolf found shelter
                in a cove of rock that cradled the mountain. The young pup lay in that shelter of stone and mourned while the storm took two days to blow itself out.

                They were both startled and neither took a specific stance, other than shock.
